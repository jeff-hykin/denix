Excellent! The prompt.md is now properly structured. Let me create a brief summary document for you:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

I've successfully enforced the rules you requested by editing prompt.md:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added Critical Rules Section at Top** - Now the first thing the bot sees:
   - Focus on what's NOT done (no achievements)
   - Break down large tasks
   - No such thing as a blocker

2. **Added Mandatory Work Order Section**:
   - Runtime testing MUST be done first (currently 38.5% - unacceptable)
   - DO NOT work on translator until runtime is 80%+ tested
   - DO NOT work on nixpkgs tests until runtime is complete
   - Added warning: "If you find yourself doing something else, STOP"

3. **Enhanced Documentation Requirements**:
   - "ALWAYS Read Documentation While Working" section
   - Links to nix.dev, noogle.dev, GitHub search patterns
   - Emphasis on testing in nix repl FIRST
   - Reminder about esm.sh for npm modules

4. **Removed Achievement Language**:
   - Changed "✅ Test Files That Exist" → "Test Files That Already Exist (DO NOT CREATE THESE)"
   - Changed "❌ Test Files Needed" → "Test Files That MUST Be Created"
   - Removed "PRODUCTION READY" and other achievement markers
   - Focused status section on "What's NOT Done"

5. **Added "WHAT NOT TO DO" Section**:
   - Clear list of blocked activities
   - "Don't report achievements" explicitly stated

6. **Enhanced REMEMBER Section**:
   - Added step-by-step breakdown for Task 1
   - "Report what bugs were found and fixed (not 'success')"
   - Emphasis on reading docs while working

### The prompt.md now:
- Enforces the work order (runtime → translator → nix-lib)
- Requires documentation reading before implementing
- Reminds about esm.sh for npm packages
- Focuses entirely on remaining work, not achievements
- Provides clear task breakdown with checkpoints

The bot should now stay focused on runtime testing and follow the proper implementation process!
