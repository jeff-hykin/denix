Perfect! All 206 tests passing (was 202, gained 4 from converting standalone_test.js to proper Deno.test format).

Now let me create a summary document for the user:

## Summary: Codebase Simplification Complete

I've reviewed and simplified the Denix codebase as the architect. Here's what I found and fixed:

### ✅ Good News: Codebase is Already Clean

The codebase is **well-structured and minimal**:
- Clean directory structure (main/, tools/, tests/)
- 56 total files (appropriate size)
- No dead code found
- All files actively used
- Good separation of concerns

### 🎯 Simplifications Made

1. **Reduced prompt.md from 991 → 210 lines (78% reduction)**
   - Removed verbose "coaching" sections
   - Removed redundant "blocker" discussion
   - Focused on actionable task list
   - Clear priority ranking (Tasks 1-10)

2. **Fixed standalone_test.js inconsistency**
   - Converted from console.log style to Deno.test()
   - Now consistent with all other test files
   - Properly integrates with test runner
   - Gained 4 tests in total count (202 → 206)

3. **Updated ARCHITECTURE.md priorities**
   - Clear development roadmap
   - Focused on 80% coverage goal
   - Removed vague language

### 📊 Testing System Assessment

**Current system is GOOD:**
- `./test.sh` provides category-based testing
- Can run all tests or specific groups
- Supports pattern matching
- 27 test files organized by category

**Test categories work well:**
```bash
./test.sh                 # All tests (206 passing)
./test.sh lists           # List operations (to be created)
./test.sh attrs           # Attrset operations (to be created)
./test.sh derivation      # Derivation tests (16 tests)
./test.sh translator      # Translator tests (87 tests)
./test.sh import          # Import system (49 tests)
```

### 🎯 Refocused Priorities in prompt.md

**Clear priority order:**
1. ⚡ Task 2: List operations (10 functions) - START HERE
2. ⚡ Task 3: Attrset operations (6 functions)
3. Task 4-6: String, Math, Path operations (24 functions) → 80% coverage
4. Task 7-10: Optional (19 functions) → 95% coverage

**What to skip:**
- Derivations (basic functionality complete, 16 tests passing)
- Translator (100% tested, 87/87 passing)
- Import system (fully implemented, 49 tests)

### 📁 Directory Structure (Validated)

```

├── main.js                 # Translator (1,278 lines)
├── main/
│   ├── runtime.js          # 109 builtins (2,314 lines) ← NEEDS TESTING
│   ├── import_*.js         # Import system (3 files)
│   ├── fetcher.js, tar.js, nar_hash.js, store_manager.js
│   └── tests/              # 27 test files (206 tests passing)
├── tools/                  # 11 utility modules
├── test.sh                 # Category-based test runner
├── prompt.md               # Development guide (210 lines, simplified)
├── ARCHITECTURE.md         # System design
├── TESTING.md              # Test guide
└── README.md               # User overview
```

### 🚀 Next Steps for Other Bot

**IMMEDIATE:** Start Task 2 (List Operations)
- Create `main/tests/builtins_lists_comprehensive_test.js`
- Test 10 functions: map, filter, all, any, elem, elemAt, partition, sort, genList, concatLists
- 5-7 hours estimated
- Run: `./test.sh lists`

**Focus:** Runtime needs testing, NOT new features.

All tests passing ✅ (206 tests)
Codebase simplified ✅
Priorities clear ✅
