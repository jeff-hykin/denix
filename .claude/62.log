Excellent! The prompt.md has been properly updated with all the enforcement rules. Let me create a summary of what was done:

## Summary

I've successfully updated the `prompt.md` file to enforce the coaching rules you specified:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added Mission Statement at the top** (lines 3-15):
   - Emphasizes focusing ONLY on what's NOT implemented
   - NEVER report achievements or completed work
   - Absolute rules section with clear ❌ and ✅ indicators
   - Always base implementations on official Nix documentation at https://noogle.dev

2. **Enhanced Work Priority Rules** (lines 17-26):
   - Clear ordering: Runtime first → Translator second → Nix-lib tests third
   - Explicitly states to ONLY work on network fetchers and store functions

3. **Strengthened Documentation Requirements** (lines 28-43):
   - Mandatory requirement to read https://noogle.dev before ANY implementation
   - Must study ALL examples and parameters
   - Must match official Nix 2.18 behavior exactly
   - Never guess - always verify against documentation

4. **Removed ALL checkboxes** (✅):
   - Converted checkbox lists to plain lists
   - Changed "[ ]" to descriptive text without checkboxes
   - Prevents achievement reporting

5. **Enhanced npm module guidance** (lines 53-73):
   - Clarified that npm modules ARE allowed via esm.sh
   - Provided clear examples
   - Emphasized testing imports first

6. **Added stronger documentation reminders** throughout:
   - Multiple references to https://noogle.dev
   - Warnings before each implementation section
   - "DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT READING" statements

7. **Final enforcement section** (lines 786-799):
   - Absolute requirements checklist
   - Reminder about no blockers
   - Never report achievements
   - Always read noogle.dev documentation

The prompt.md now strongly enforces:
- ✅ Focus on remaining work ONLY
- ✅ Read https://noogle.dev documentation before ANY implementation
- ✅ Work priority: Runtime → Translator → Nix-lib tests
- ✅ No achievement reporting
- ✅ npm modules allowed via esm.sh
- ❌ No completion checkboxes
- ❌ No "we implemented X" statements

The bot should now stay on track and follow these rules consistently!
