Perfect! I've successfully enforced all the rules. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

I've edited the prompt.md file to enforce the coaching rules:

### ✅ Added to Top (Lines 3-9):
- **Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working**
- Only report what remains to be done, not accomplishments
- Filter out achievements before executing
- Senior developer mindset - no blockers exist

### ✅ Fixed Work Order (Lines 11-13):
- **Runtime FIRST** (finish network fetchers and store functions)
- **Translator SECOND** (do not work until runtime complete)
- **nix-lib tests LAST** (do not work until translator complete)

### ✅ Added Documentation Requirements (Lines 15-20):
- **ALWAYS read Nix documentation WHILE implementing** (with example URLs)
- Search internet for additional documentation
- Verify in nix repl before implementing
- npm modules only via `https://esm.sh/` (noted as unreliable)

### ✅ Removed Achievements:
- Removed all checkmarks (✅) and achievement language
- Changed "100% feature complete" to "74% untested"
- Changed "ALL builtins implemented" to "70+ builtins need tests"
- Removed congratulatory language throughout

### ✅ Added "What Remains" Focus:
- Every section now starts with "What remains to be done"
- Every task includes "Before starting" with documentation links
- Every priority emphasizes untested/unimplemented items
- Final section reminds: "Focus on what is NOT done"

### ✅ Enhanced Every Task Section:
- Added "Read docs FIRST" reminders with specific URLs
- Added "Test in nix repl" requirements
- Added "Break down the task" guidance
- Added "Required coverage" minimums

The file now strongly enforces the rules and will keep the other bot focused on remaining work, not achievements.
