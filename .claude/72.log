Perfect! Now let me create a summary for you:

## Summary

I've successfully updated `prompt.md` to enforce your rules and reflect the actual state of the project:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added mandatory instructions at the top** (as you requested):
   - Focus only on what's NOT implemented
   - Don't report achievements
   - Break down large tasks
   - Runtime must be complete before translator
   - Translator must be complete before nix-lib tests

2. **Corrected the actual status**:
   - The previous prompt.md said only 3 optional builtins remained
   - But it was outdated - I discovered that **62/65 builtins are now FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
   - Network fetchers (fetchTarball, fetchurl, fetchGit, fetchTree) ✅ DONE
   - Store operations (path, filterSource) ✅ DONE
   - Support modules (fetcher.js, tar.js, nar_hash.js, store_manager.js) ✅ DONE

3. **Only 3 optional builtins remain**:
   - `fetchMercurial` (Mercurial is deprecated)
   - `fetchClosure` (experimental, very complex)
   - `getFlake` (experimental, massive scope)

4. **Added reminders** throughout:
   - Always read Noogle docs: `https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/BUILTIN_NAME`
   - Always read Nix manual before implementing
   - Can use npm via `https://esm.sh/NPM_MODULE_NAME` (but it's unreliable)
   - Base implementations on Nix documentation and behavior

5. **Removed all achievement checkboxes** and accomplishment language

6. **Clear next steps**: The agent should either implement the 3 optional builtins OR move to the next phase (testing/translator work) since runtime is effectively complete.

The prompt now accurately reflects reality and will keep the other agent focused on remaining work only! 🎯
