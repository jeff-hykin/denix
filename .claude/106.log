Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the changes for the user:

## Summary

I've updated `prompt.md` to enforce strict rules and keep the other bot focused. Here are the key changes:

### 🎯 Added Critical Instructions Section at Top
- Clear statement: "Focus ONLY on what is NOT implemented and NOT working"
- Explicit work order: Runtime testing → Translator → nixpkgs.lib (must follow sequence)
- **Documentation-driven development**: 5-step mandatory process requiring reading Nix docs and testing in `nix repl` BEFORE implementing
- External dependencies note: Can use npm via esm.sh but it's unreliable

### ❌ Removed All Achievement Language
- Changed "3 bugs just fixed" → "Problem: Only 28/97 tested"
- Changed "Functions: X, Y, Z" → "**Untested functions**: X, Y, Z"
- Changed "Time: X hours" → "**Remaining time**: X hours"
- Added "NEEDS CREATION" markers for non-existent test files
- Emphasized what's **missing** rather than what exists

### 📋 Enhanced Every Task Section
- Added "**Before starting (MANDATORY):**" sections with explicit steps
- Required reading Nix 2.18 docs: https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/language/builtins
- Required testing in `nix repl` before writing any tests
- Added specific bug risk levels (HIGH/VERY HIGH/CONFIRMED INCOMPLETE)
- Made it clear which test files don't exist yet

### 🚫 Strengthened "What NOT to Do" Section
- Changed from "Don't do X" → "❌ **DO NOT** do X - rules to enforce"
- Added 7 strict rules including "DO NOT report accomplishments"
- Added reminder about 100% bug discovery rate
- Made consequences explicit: "Every untested function is a production crash waiting to happen"

### 📚 Added Common Bug Patterns Section
- Documented the 3 bugs already found (null checks, variable typos, wrong return types)
- Provided code examples of BAD vs GOOD patterns
- Highlighted TODO comments as indicators of incomplete code

The prompt now acts as a strict coach that will keep the other bot focused on testing, not accomplishing, and always reading documentation first.
