Perfect! I've updated prompt.md with a comprehensive, detailed breakdown of what needs to be done to implement fetchTarball. The document now contains:

1. **Current Status** - Accurate numbers (61/98 builtins, 9 unimplemented)
2. **Priority 1: Implement fetchTarball** - The highest priority task broken down into 7 detailed sections:
   - 1.1 Research & Design (1-2 hours)
   - 1.2 Store Path Computation (2-3 hours)
   - 1.3 Tarball Download (1-2 hours)
   - 1.4 Tarball Extraction (1-2 hours)
   - 1.5 Directory Hashing (2-3 hours)
   - 1.6 Integration (1-2 hours)
   - 1.7 Testing (2-3 hours)
3. **Priority 2: Other Fetch Builtins** - fetchurl, fetchGit, fetchTree (future work)
4. **Priority 3: Other Missing Builtins** - path, filterSource, getFlake (future work)
5. **Implementation Strategy** - 3-phase approach (MVP → Robustness → Pure JS)
6. **Common Pitfalls** - 8 important gotchas to avoid
7. **Next Immediate Action** - Clear starting point (Section 1.1)

The document focuses entirely on REMAINING WORK (not accomplishments) and provides concrete, actionable tasks with time estimates. Each sub-task has specific deliverables and test criteria.
