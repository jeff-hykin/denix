Perfect! The prompt.md is now cleaned up. Let me create a summary for you:

## Summary: prompt.md Successfully Updated ✅

I've successfully updated `/Users/jeffhykin/repos/denix/prompt.md` to enforce the rules you specified. Here's what changed:

### ✅ Added at the top:
1. **MISSION STATEMENT** - Focus only on what's NOT implemented, never report achievements
2. **CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS** section with strict enforcement rules:
   - Do NOT work on nix-lib tests until runtime is complete
   - Do NOT work on translator (already complete)
   - ONLY focus on 5 remaining runtime builtins
3. **BEFORE YOU START - MANDATORY CHECKLIST** - Must read documentation at https://noogle.dev before coding

### ❌ Removed all achievements:
- Deleted "Recently Completed (Session 24)" section (lines 36-72)
- Removed all ✅ checkboxes from status table
- Removed "Completed Implementation Notes" section
- Updated status table to show only 5 NOT IMPLEMENTED builtins

### 📝 Enhanced documentation requirements:
- Added strong emphasis on reading https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/<function_name> FIRST
- Added mandatory checklist before starting any implementation
- Added clear completion criteria tied to documentation verification
- Added note about using npm modules via https://esm.sh (with testing caveat)

### 🎯 Reorganized remaining work:
- Clear priority order: fetchGit → fetchTree → fetchMercurial → fetchClosure → getFlake
- Detailed breakdown of what needs to be done for each builtin
- Testing checklists with [ ] unchecked boxes
- Documentation links for every builtin

The prompt now strictly enforces: **"Finish the network fetchers and store functions in runtime.js before doing ANYTHING ELSE"** and requires reading Nix documentation at https://noogle.dev before starting any implementation.
