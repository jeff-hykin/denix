Excellent! Now let me create a summary document for the user explaining the changes:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

I've successfully edited prompt.md to enforce the coaching rules. Here's what changed:

### ✅ Added at the Top (Lines 3-22):
1. **CRITICAL RULES section** with your exact statement:
   - "Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working..."
   - Clear emphasis on senior developer mindset (no blockers)

2. **STRICT WORK ORDER** section:
   - Runtime FIRST → Translator SECOND → Nixpkgs LAST
   - Explicit "DO NOT VIOLATE" warning

3. **MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS**:
   - Read Nix docs WHILE implementing
   - Test in nix repl before/during
   - Search for examples
   - Compare outputs exactly

4. **EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES**:
   - Prefer Deno std library
   - npm via esm.sh is allowed but unreliable
   - No direct npm/jsr imports

### ✅ Removed Achievement Reporting (Lines 163-179):
- **Deleted "What's Working ✅" section** (was listing all accomplishments)
- **Deleted "Known Fixed Issues" section** (was listing fixes as achievements)
- **Kept only "What Needs Work ⚠️"** section focused on remaining tasks

### ✅ Enhanced Process Section (Lines 30-60):
- Expanded test development process with mandatory steps
- Added **"DO NOT SKIP STEP 1 AND 2!"** warning
- Added explicit nix repl testing instructions
- Emphasized reading docs FIRST before coding

### ✅ Added Self-Check Sections (Lines 239-265):
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid** (6 specific anti-patterns)
- **Self-Check Questions** (5 checkboxes for the bot to verify)
- **Enhanced "Next Immediate Action"** with BEFORE steps

### Key Enforcement Mechanisms:

1. **Top-heavy design**: Most important rules at the very top
2. **Bold warnings**: "DO NOT VIOLATE", "FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY", "DO NOT SKIP"
3. **Specific examples**: nix repl commands, doc URLs for each task
4. **Self-check questions**: Forces reflection before acting
5. **Removed all ✅ checkboxes**: No achievement tracking

The document now focuses 100% on **what remains to be done** with clear, actionable steps and strict adherence to the work order: Runtime → Translator → Nixpkgs.
