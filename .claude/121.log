Perfect! The prompt.md file has been completely rewritten to enforce all the rules you specified:

## Summary of Changes

✅ **Added enforcement rules at the top:**
- "YOUR JOB: Focus on What is NOT Working"
- "YOU ARE A SENIOR LEVEL DEVELOPER - THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BLOCKER"
- Clear instruction to only report remaining tasks, not achievements

✅ **Added CRITICAL WORK ORDER section:**
- Runtime testing FIRST (62 untested builtins)
- THEN translator improvements
- THEN nixpkgs.lib testing
- Explicit: "DO NOT work on translator or nix-lib tests until runtime testing is complete"

✅ **Added MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS:**
- Step-by-step instructions to ALWAYS read Nix documentation first
- Links to https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/language/builtins.html
- Instructions to test in `nix repl` before implementing
- Example workflow for builtins.fetchClosure

✅ **Added NPM modules section:**
- Reminder that npm modules are allowed via https://esm.sh/NPM_MODULE_NAME
- Warning that esm.sh is often unreliable

✅ **Removed ALL achievements and checkboxes:**
- No ✅ or completed items
- Only focuses on what needs to be done
- 62 untested builtins clearly listed with priorities

✅ **Added detailed task breakdowns:**
- 6 priority levels (Priority 1-6) for runtime testing
- Each priority has specific functions to test
- Each has nix repl examples showing expected behavior
- Each has minimum test counts and time estimates
- Each lists critical edge cases to test

✅ **Added References section:**
- Links to Nix docs, Noogle, Nix source, nixpkgs lib source

The file is now **397 lines** of focused, actionable guidance with NO achievements reported - only what remains to be done. The other bot should now stay on track!
