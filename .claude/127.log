Great! The file looks good. Now let me create a summary of the changes for the user:

## Summary

I've updated `prompt.md` to enforce the rules you specified. Here are the key changes:

### Added at the Top (Lines 1-51):
1. **CRITICAL RULES** section emphasizing:
   - Focus only on what's NOT done (no achievements)
   - No blockers exist - break down large tasks
   - Senior developer mindset

2. **WORK ORDER (MUST FOLLOW STRICTLY)** section:
   - Runtime must be finished FIRST (80% test coverage minimum)
   - Translator can ONLY be worked on after runtime is complete
   - nixpkgs.lib testing can ONLY be done after translator is complete
   - Clear "DO NOT PROCEED" warnings between stages

3. **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS** section:
   - Always read Nix documentation (links provided)
   - Test in `nix repl` before implementing
   - Search noogle.dev for examples
   - Step-by-step process: docs → nix repl → tests → fix → verify
   - NPM modules via esm.sh (with caveat about reliability)

### Enhanced Testing Process (Lines 72-122):
- **MANDATORY STEPS** before writing tests
- 6-step process with documentation links
- Examples showing how to verify behavior in `nix repl`

### Added Near the End (Lines 150-169):
- **WHAT NOT TO DO** section (7 explicit violations with ❌)
- **WHAT TO DO** section (7 explicit actions with ✓)
- Reinforces the work order and documentation requirements

### Result:
The prompt now:
- Has NO checkboxes or achievements (was already clean)
- Starts with critical rules that can't be missed
- Enforces the Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs.lib workflow
- Requires documentation reading before implementation
- Reminds about esm.sh for npm modules
- Breaks down the process into mandatory steps

The other bot will now see these rules immediately and be constantly reminded to:
1. Stay focused on runtime testing (current priority)
2. Read Nix documentation before implementing
3. Test in `nix repl` to verify behavior
4. Not skip ahead to translator or nixpkgs.lib work
