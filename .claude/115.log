Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've done:

## Summary

I've successfully edited `prompt.md` to enforce your coaching rules:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced top section** (lines 3-15):
   - Added your exact rule statement at the very top
   - Emphasized "filter out achievements" instruction
   - Clarified work order: "Finish testing runtime.js builtins before doing ANYTHING ELSE"

2. **Strengthened documentation requirements** (lines 17-45):
   - Expanded MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS with NO EXCEPTIONS warning
   - Added detailed step-by-step documentation reading requirements
   - Emphasized that implementations without docs/testing WILL BE WRONG
   - Added links to Nix source code for when docs are unclear

3. **Added "WHEN YOU FEEL BLOCKED" section** (lines 47-72):
   - Teaches senior developer mindset: no blockers, only tasks to break down
   - Provides concrete examples of decomposing complex tasks
   - Reinforces that research and breakdown are always possible

4. **Enhanced external dependencies section** (lines 74-79):
   - Added WARNING that esm.sh is UNRELIABLE
   - Emphasized need for fallback plans

5. **Reformatted "Current State"** (lines 83-98):
   - Removed all ✅ checkmarks
   - Changed structure to "REMAINING WORK" first (what to focus on)
   - Moved completed items to "DO NOT MODIFY" section at bottom
   - Emphasized 69 untested builtins as PRIMARY TASK

6. **Expanded Test Development Process** (lines 100-160):
   - Changed to "MANDATORY STEPS - NO EXCEPTIONS" 
   - Each step has detailed sub-requirements
   - Added DO NOT PROCEED warnings between steps
   - Emphasized Steps 1-2 are NOT OPTIONAL

7. **Removed achievement language** throughout:
   - Changed "✅ Already tested:" to "Already tested (skip):"
   - Changed "❌ UNTESTED" to "UNTESTED (your work)"
   - Changed "✅ What's Complete" to "Areas to SKIP"
   - Changed "✅ COMPLETE (SKIP THIS)" to "SKIP (Already Done)"

8. **Enhanced Common Mistakes** (lines 475-512):
   - Restructured as ❌ WRONG vs ✓ GOOD examples
   - Added 8 concrete mistake patterns with corrections
   - Shows exactly what NOT to do and what to do instead

9. **Strengthened Self-Check section** (lines 514-541):
   - Reorganized into 4 categories: Work Order, Priority, Quality, Simplicity
   - Added enforcement questions with consequences
   - "IF ANY CHECK FAILS, STOP AND CORRECT COURSE"

The prompt now:
- **Enforces** work order (runtime → translator → nixpkgs)
- **Requires** reading Nix docs and testing in nix repl before implementing
- **Eliminates** achievement reporting (focus on remaining work only)
- **Emphasizes** task breakdown (no "blockers" allowed)
- **Reminds** about esm.sh unreliability and documentation sources

The bot should now stay on track and focus exclusively on testing the 69 untested runtime builtins, starting with Task 2 (List Operations).
