Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've done:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

I've strengthened the enforcement rules to keep the other bot on track:

### 1. **Enhanced CRITICAL RULES section** (lines 3-31)
   - Added **MANDATORY WORK ORDER** with clear sequence enforcement
   - Changed "Current Status" to "Current Gap Analysis" emphasizing what's NOT done
   - Added explicit prohibition: "DO NOT work on translator until runtime testing is complete"
   - Emphasized the problem: "71% of runtime code has NO TESTS"

### 2. **Expanded MANDATORY PROCESS section** (lines 33-58)
   - Changed title to include "& TESTING PROCESS"
   - Added "ALWAYS READ DOCUMENTATION WHILE WORKING - THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE"
   - Made documentation reading requirements more explicit with examples
   - Added specific URL patterns for looking up functions
   - Enhanced nix repl workflow with concrete examples
   - Added network fetcher documentation links for future work

### 3. **Enhanced Current State section** (lines 60-76)
   - Added "Why testing matters - Functions might be broken" section
   - Listed specific risks (wrong values, crashes, wrong errors)
   - Added emphasis: "69 untested functions = 71% of runtime unverified = HIGH RISK"

### 4. **Enhanced Documentation section** (lines 335-361)
   - Added concrete workflow example for testing builtins.map
   - Step-by-step process with URLs, repl commands, expected outputs
   - Emphasized "ALWAYS test in nix repl before writing tests!"

### 5. **Added ENFORCEMENT RULES section** (lines 408-437)
   - New section at the end with 4 enforcement categories:
     - What to do if reporting progress/achievements (STOP, remove them)
     - What to do if feeling blocked (STOP, break down task)
     - What to do if tempted to skip ahead (STOP, follow work order)
     - Mandatory workflow for every work session
   - Ends with reminder: "Read documentation before implementing. Break down large tasks."

The prompt.md now has **strong guardrails** to prevent the other bot from:
- Reporting achievements instead of remaining work
- Skipping runtime testing to work on translator/nixpkgs
- Implementing without reading documentation
- Claiming blockers exist
- Working without testing in nix repl first
