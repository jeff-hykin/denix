Perfect! The document is well-structured and action-oriented. Now let me write a brief summary of what was updated for the memory system:

The prompt.md has been completely rewritten with:

1. **Immediate action section** at top: Clear directive to test fixed-points.nix first
2. **Current status**: Factual summary of what exists
3. **Blockers**: None currently 
4. **Remaining work**: Detailed breakdown of:
   - Task 1.1: Test fixed-points.nix (9 functions, with code examples)
   - Task 1.2: Implement makeTestLib() helper (with full code)
   - Tasks 1.3-1.5: Test trivial, lists, attrsets through lib context
5. **Key discoveries documented**:
   - nixpkgs.lib files have circular dependencies through fixed-point pattern
   - default.nix cannot be tested (needs full nixpkgs structure)
   - Must create custom makeTestLib() using lib.fix
6. **Task checklist** for tracking progress
7. **Investigation section** for future work

All tests currently passing (73 tests, 64 steps). Ready to proceed with testing fixed-points.nix.
