Perfect! All the updates are in place. Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished and what remains to be done according to prompt.md:

## Summary

I've completed **Priority 0: Fix Misleading Documentation** from prompt.md. Here's what was done:

### Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Updated README.md** with accurate numbers:
   - Badge: Fixed test count (120+ → 170+ passing tests)
   - Removed broken STATUS.md badge link
   - Updated builtin count (59 → 61 implemented)
   - Updated runtime tests (120+ → 170+)
   - Updated translator tests (67 → 87)
   - Added import system to features list
   - Fixed all broken STATUS.md references → main/runtime.js
   - Removed incorrect "Import/eval (2)" from unimplemented list (these ARE implemented!)
   - Updated architecture section with import system files
   - Updated total tests (180+ → 240+)
   - Added all 8 missing test suites to translator test table

2. **Deleted error_messages_test.js**: This file was actively misleading - it tested stub implementations that claimed import/scopedImport were unimplemented, when in reality they ARE fully implemented in the runtime.

3. **Updated prompt.md**: Removed completed Priority 0 section and renumbered priorities.

4. **Updated MEMORY.md**: Added Session 19 entry documenting the documentation cleanup.

### Tests Verified ✅

All tests still passing after changes (240+ tests across all suites).

### Next Priority (from prompt.md)

**Priority 1 - Examples Directory (2-3 days)**:
- Create `examples/` directory structure with 10-15 Nix → JS translation examples
- Extract examples from existing tests
- Create examples/README.md explaining translation patterns
- Create verify_examples.js automated verification script
- Show key patterns: BigInt usage, scope management, lazy evaluation, string interpolation

This will make the project much more accessible to users by showing concrete examples of how Nix code translates to JavaScript.
