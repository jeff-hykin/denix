Perfect! Now let me create a summary for the user:

## Summary

I've successfully enhanced **prompt.md** with comprehensive implementation details for all remaining work. Here's what I added:

### 📋 What Was Added to prompt.md

**1. Decision Tree (40 lines)**
- Clear flowchart showing what to work on next
- Three main paths: Optional builtins, Translator improvements, or Testing expansion
- Recommended path with time estimates (10-16 days to production-ready)

**2. Detailed Implementation Guidance (200+ lines)**
- **fetchMercurial**: Step-by-step with code snippets, hg commands, 2-3 day estimate
- **fetchClosure**: 4-phase breakdown (NAR unpacking, closure computation, binary cache client), 5-7 days
- **getFlake**: 4-phase breakdown (lock parsing, input resolution, evaluation model), 5-7 days
- **fetchTree edge cases**: Quick implementations for type='path' and type='indirect'

**3. "AFTER RUNTIME IS COMPLETE" Section (150+ lines)**
- **Phase 1**: Translator edge cases (pattern matching, escapes, paths, operators)
- **Phase 2**: nixpkgs.lib test coverage expansion (lists.nix, attrsets.nix, options.nix, modules.nix)
- **Phase 3**: Translator optimizations (code generation, scope management, source maps)
- **Phase 4**: Real-world integration testing (flakes, NixOS modules, limitations docs)

**4. Quick Reference Section (60+ lines)**
- Common development commands (running tests, translating Nix, adding builtins)
- Copy-paste ready code snippets
- Troubleshooting commands

**5. Enhanced Status Section**
- Accurate Session 24 status (62/65 builtins, 179+ runtime tests, 240+ total tests)
- Lists all 6 new test files created in Session 24
- Lists all 4 new support modules from Session 24

### 📊 Current State

**Runtime**: 62/65 builtins (95% complete) ✅
- Only 3 optional/experimental builtins remain (fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake)
- All common fetch operations implemented and tested
- All support infrastructure complete

**Next Steps**: See prompt.md decision tree
- **Option A**: Implement optional builtins (16-22 days if needed)
- **Option B**: Translator improvements (2-3 days, RECOMMENDED)
- **Option C**: More nixpkgs.lib testing (4-6 days)

The prompt.md file has grown from **181 lines → 750+ lines** with actionable, detailed guidance for every remaining task!
