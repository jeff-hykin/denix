Excellent! The prompt.md is now properly structured. Let me create a summary for the user:

## Summary

I've successfully updated `/Users/jeffhykin/repos/denix/prompt.md` to enforce all the rules you specified:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added CRITICAL RULES section at the top** with:
   - Clear mandate: Focus ONLY on what's NOT done, no accomplishments
   - "Senior developer - no blockers" mindset
   - Requirement to break down large tasks

2. **Added MANDATORY WORK ORDER**:
   - Runtime builtins FIRST (80%+ coverage)
   - Translator SECOND
   - Network fetchers & store functions BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

3. **Added Implementation Guidelines**:
   - Always read Nix documentation while implementing
   - Test in `nix repl` BEFORE writing code
   - Search internet for documentation (especially for fetchClosure, getFlake)
   - NPM modules only via esm.sh (with caveat it's unreliable)

4. **Removed achievements**:
   - Removed "✅ DONE" items (Type Checking, List Operations)
   - Changed "57 functions" to "35 functions remaining"
   - Removed completed Task 2

5. **Enhanced all task sections**:
   - Added "BEFORE WRITING TESTS" checklists
   - Emphasized reading Nix docs first
   - Required testing in `nix repl` and documenting outputs

6. **Added Priority 0 verification**:
   - Must verify network fetchers work FIRST
   - Clear instructions to NOT proceed until complete

The document now enforces a strict work order and emphasizes documentation-driven development.
