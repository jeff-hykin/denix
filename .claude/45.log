Perfect! Now prompt.md is clean and organized properly. The document now:

1. **Clearly shows what remains to be done** (no accomplishments reported)
2. **Properly prioritized** sections (Priority 1-5)
3. **Detailed task breakdowns** for each priority level
4. **No duplicate sections** or confusing numbering
5. **Focus on actionable next steps**

The key remaining work is:

**Priority 1 (NEXT)**: Test 19 more nixpkgs.lib files
**Priority 2**: Implement store path system 
**Priority 3**: Implement network fetchers (fetchurl, fetchTarball)
**Priority 4-5**: Performance optimization and documentation (deferred)

The document is now ready for the next agent to pick up and continue with Priority 1 tasks (testing more nixpkgs.lib files like debug.nix, licenses.nix, cli.nix).
