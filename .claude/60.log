Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what I've done:

## Summary

I've successfully updated the `prompt.md` file to enforce the rules you specified:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added Mission Statement at the top** (lines 3-7):
   - Clear instruction to focus on what's NOT implemented
   - No reporting achievements
   - Senior developer mindset (no blockers)
   - Filter out achievements, keep only remaining tasks

2. **Added Strict Work Priority Rules** (lines 9-17):
   - DO NOT work on nix-lib tests until translator is done
   - DO NOT work on translator until runtime is done
   - ONLY work on network fetchers and store functions first
   - Clear ordering: Runtime → Translator → Nix-lib tests

3. **Enhanced Documentation Requirements** (lines 19-42):
   - Strong emphasis on reading https://noogle.dev FIRST
   - Multiple reminders to base implementations on Nix documentation
   - Clear warning against guessing behavior
   - Step-by-step checklist before starting any implementation

4. **Removed All Achievement Checkboxes**:
   - Removed ✅ checkmarks from instructions
   - Changed "you're done" language to "requirements not met"
   - Focused on what remains, not what's complete

5. **Added NPM Module Usage Section** (lines 44-57):
   - Clear instructions on using https://esm.sh/PACKAGE_NAME
   - Warning that not all modules work
   - Reminder to test first

6. **Added Strong Reporting Rules** (lines 59-67):
   - Multiple ❌ for what NOT to do (no achievements)
   - Clear ✅ for what to do (only remaining work)

7. **Added Final Reminders Section** (at end):
   - 8-point checklist before starting
   - Emphasis on reading https://noogle.dev
   - Reminder about work order
   - Clear starting point (fetchGit)

The prompt now strongly enforces:
- Reading Nix documentation (https://noogle.dev) before implementing anything
- Working in the correct order (runtime first)
- No achievement reporting
- Breaking down tasks
- Basing implementations on official Nix behavior, not guesses
