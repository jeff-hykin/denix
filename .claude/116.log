Perfect! Let me create a final summary document showing what work was done:

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive update to `prompt.md` with accurate, detailed information about remaining test work. Here's what remains to be done:

### Key Findings (Session 35)

**Accurate Counts Verified:**
- ✅ 109 function builtins implemented (100% code complete)
- ✅ 40 builtins tested (37% coverage)
- ❌ **69 builtins UNTESTED** (63% - the work that remains)
- 🎯 Need 47 more tests to reach 80% coverage

### What I Added to prompt.md

1. **Quick Status Section** (Lines 3-24)
   - Clear summary of what's working vs what's not
   - Emphasis on NOT working on completed areas (translator, imports, derivations)

2. **Complete List of 69 Untested Builtins** (Lines 106-230)
   - Organized by category (List, Attrset, String, Math, Path, Hashing, etc.)
   - ✅ marks for tested functions
   - ❌ marks for untested functions
   - CRITICAL labels for highest priority

3. **Enhanced Task Sections** (Tasks 2-10)
   - Corrected function counts per task
   - Listed "Already tested" vs "UNTESTED" functions
   - Added specific nix repl commands for testing
   - Added key edge cases to test
   - Added minimum test count requirements
   - Added time estimates per function

4. **Quick Reference Guide** (Lines 444-526)
   - Summary of each test file's contents
   - Key edge cases per file
   - Minimum test counts

5. **Detailed Next Immediate Action** (Lines 604-710)
   - Step-by-step process for Task 2 (List operations)
   - Mandatory steps with time estimates
   - Special attention items (lazyMap proxy, lazy evaluation)
   - Required test coverage checklist

6. **Progress Tracker** (Lines 712-783)
   - Visual progress bar (40/87 = 46%)
   - Task completion checklist
   - Time to key milestones
   - Clear "What NOT to Work On" section

### Corrected Totals

**Tasks 2-6 (to 80%):**
- Task 2: List operations (10 functions, 5-7 hours) ⚡ CRITICAL
- Task 3: Attrset operations (6 functions, 3-5 hours) ⚡ CRITICAL  
- Task 4: String operations (5 functions, 3-4 hours)
- Task 5: Math & bitwise (8 functions, 3-4 hours)
- Task 6: Path/file operations (11 functions, 4-6 hours) - CORRECTED from 7
- **Total: 40 functions, 18-26 hours**

**Tasks 7-10 (after 80%):**
- Task 7: Hashing & Context (9 functions, 4-5 hours) - CORRECTED from 6
- Task 8: Control Flow (3 functions, 1-2 hours) - CORRECTED from 4
- Task 9: JSON/Conversion (1 function, 0.5-1 hour) - CORRECTED from 2
- Task 10: Advanced/Optional (6 functions, 4-6 hours) - CORRECTED from 8
- **Total: 19 functions, 9.5-14 hours**

### Updated Files

1. **prompt.md** (991 lines, was ~602 lines, +389 lines of detail)
   - Added Quick Status section
   - Added complete untested builtin list
   - Enhanced all task sections
   - Added quick reference guide
   - Added progress tracker

2. **MEMORY.md** (Session 35 entry added)
   - Updated with Session 35 verification details
   - Corrected immediate action requirements
   - Added Session 35 to history

### What Remains to Be Done

**Immediate next step**: Create `main/tests/builtins_lists_comprehensive_test.js`

**Priority order:**
1. Test CRITICAL functions first: map, filter, all, any, getAttr, attrNames, attrValues (7 functions, 5-6 hours)
2. Complete Tasks 2-6 to reach 80% (40 functions, 18-26 hours total)
3. Optionally continue to 90%+ with Tasks 7-10 (19 functions, 9.5-14 hours)

**DO NOT work on:**
- ❌ Translator (100% complete)
- ❌ Import system (100% complete)
- ❌ Derivations (sufficient for now)
- ❌ Type checking (100% complete)

The prompt.md file now provides a complete, accurate roadmap for testing all untested builtins.
