Perfect! Now let me create a quick summary for the user:

## Architectural Simplification Complete! ✅

I've successfully analyzed and simplified the denix codebase. Here's what I did:

### 🧹 Cleanup Actions

1. **Removed dead code:** Deleted `tools/git.js` (unused file importing non-existent dependencies)
2. **Fixed broken test:** `operators.js` now handles BigInt serialization correctly
3. **Enhanced test runner:** `test.sh` now supports categories (runtime, translator, derivation, import, infra, integration)

### 📚 New Documentation

Created three comprehensive documents:

1. **TESTING.md** - Complete testing guide
   - Test organization by category
   - How to run specific test groups
   - Coverage gaps identified
   - Guidelines for writing new tests

2. **SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md** - Analysis document
   - Dead code analysis
   - Test organization recommendations
   - Priority realignment rationale

3. **ARCHITECT_SESSION_2026_02_10.md** - Session summary
   - What was changed and why
   - Recommendations for next steps

### 🎯 Rewrote prompt.md

**Key changes:**
- ✅ Added "SIMPLICITY" as core principle
- ✅ Accurate project status (62/65 builtins, ~240 tests)
- ✅ Reprioritized work:
  - **Priority 1:** Derivation validation (2-4 hours) ← **START HERE**
  - **Priority 2:** Runtime builtin audit (1-2 days)
  - **Priority 3:** Translator edge cases (1-2 days)
  - **Priority 4:** nixpkgs.lib testing (3-5 days)
  - **Priority 5:** Optional builtins (2-3 weeks, OPTIONAL)
- ✅ Moved optional builtins (fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake) to lowest priority
- ✅ Clear work order: Core validation → Edge cases → Optional features

### 📊 Key Findings

**Good news:**
- Codebase is fundamentally well-structured
- Only 1 unused file found (minimal bloat)
- Clear separation of concerns
- 32 test files well organized into 6 categories

**Areas needing attention:**
- Derivation edge cases not tested (multiple outputs, passthru, meta)
- Unknown which of 62 builtins have comprehensive tests
- nixpkgs.lib coverage only 24% (10/41 files)

### 🚀 Next Steps

The other bot should:

1. **Run derivation tests** to verify what's working:
   ```bash
   ./test.sh derivation
   ```

2. **Create `main/tests/derivation/002_advanced_tests.js`** with:
   - Multiple outputs test
   - Complex env variables test
   - Passthru/meta attributes test
   - Edge cases test

3. **Then create `BUILTIN_COVERAGE.md`** to audit all 65 builtins

All priorities are now clearly defined in the new prompt.md!
