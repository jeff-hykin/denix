Perfect! All tests still passing. Now let me create a summary of what was accomplished in this session and update the documentation:

## Session Summary

I've successfully completed two major improvements to the Denix project:

### 1. Fixed Critical String Key Bug in Attribute Sets
- **Issue**: String keys in attribute sets (e.g., `{ "A" = 65; " " = 32; "\t" = 9; }`) were not handled correctly
- **Root Cause**: The translator wasn't extracting string values from `string_expression` nodes when used as attribute keys
- **Solution**: Created `extractKeyString()` helper function that:
  - Extracts static string values from `string_expression` nodes
  - Properly handles escape sequences (`\t`, `\n`, `\r`, `\\`, `\"`)
  - Returns `null` for dynamic/interpolated keys requiring runtime evaluation
- **Impact**: Unblocks testing nixpkgs.lib files that use string keys (like `ascii-table.nix`)

### 2. Implemented `inherit_from` Syntax
- **Feature**: `inherit (expr) attrs...` syntax (e.g., `inherit (builtins) add sub;`)
- **Implementation**: Added support in three contexts:
  - Let expressions
  - Recursive attribute sets
  - Non-recursive attribute sets
- **Technical Details**:
  - Creates special "select" value type for inherit_from bindings
  - For non-rec attrsets with inherit_from, uses function wrapper with scope context
  - Properly handles scope stack for variable resolution
- **Impact**: Unblocks loading nixpkgs.lib files that use this common pattern (like `flakes.nix`)

### Test Results
- ✅ All 41 translator tests passing
- ✅ All 20 nixpkgs trivial tests passing
- ✅ 4 new tests for string keys and inherit_from
- ✅ Successfully loads and validates `ascii-table.nix` (98 character mappings)

### Files Modified
- `main.js`: Added `extractKeyString()` helper, implemented inherit_from support in 3 contexts
- `main/tests/nixpkgs_lib_files_test.js`: Created comprehensive test suite for nixpkgs.lib files

The Denix translator is now more robust and can handle a wider range of real-world Nix code patterns!
