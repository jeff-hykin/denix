Great! Let me create a final summary of the work completed:

## Summary

I've successfully resumed and advanced the Nix to JavaScript translator work. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **String Interpolation** - Fully implemented for both double-quoted (`"hello ${world}"`) and indented strings (`''hello ${world}''`)
2. **Path Interpolation** - Fully implemented for paths with interpolated variables (`./${dir}/file`)
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Created 13 new tests (8 for strings, 5 for paths), bringing total translator tests from 23 to 36, all passing

### 📊 Current State

**Translator (main.js)**:
- ✅ 36/36 integration tests passing
- ✅ String interpolation complete (double-quoted and indented)
- ✅ Path interpolation complete
- ✅ Core language features working (let, with, rec, if-then-else, operators, etc.)

**Builtins (runtime.js)**:
- ✅ 59/98 Nix 2.18 builtins (100% of feasible scope)
- ✅ 120+ tests passing
- ✅ Correct derivation store paths

### 📝 Documentation Updated

- Updated `prompt.md` with completed tasks and new test counts
- Created `SESSION_2026_02_05_INTERPOLATION.md` documenting the work
- Validated that status files are current (CURRENT_STATUS.md is marked deprecated, pointing to README.md and STATUS.md)

### 🔜 Next Priority Items

According to prompt.md, the next steps are:

1. **Test against simple nixpkgs.lib functions** - Now feasible with interpolation support!
2. **Complex functions** - Full @ syntax and inherit_from support
3. **Truthy-ness handling** - Empty strings, empty lists, etc.
4. **Nested attribute paths in non-rec attrsets** - e.g., `{ a.b.c = 10; }`

The project is in excellent shape with solid test coverage and the two most important translator features (string and path interpolation) now complete!
