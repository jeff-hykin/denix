Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the changes for you:

## Summary

I've successfully edited `prompt.md` to enforce the rules you specified. Here's what changed:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added CRITICAL RULES section at the top** with:
   - Self-check checklist (4 questions to ask before responding)
   - Clear statement: "Focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working"
   - Explicit instruction: "Do not report accomplishments or achievements"
   - Emphasis: "You are a senior developer - there are no blockers, only tasks to break down"

2. **Added WORK ORDER section** enforcing the sequence:
   - Runtime builtins FIRST (currently 37% coverage → 80% target)
   - Network fetchers NEXT (only after 80% runtime coverage)
   - Translator improvements LAST
   - nixpkgs.lib tests LAST

3. **Added IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY** section emphasizing:
   - Always read Nix documentation while implementing
   - Always test behavior in `nix repl` first
   - Search the internet for documentation
   - Use noogle.dev for real-world examples
   - Use npm modules ONLY via https://esm.sh/ (unreliable)
   - Break down large tasks into intermediate steps

4. **Removed completed tasks**:
   - Removed "Task 1: Type Checking (COMPLETE - Skip)" section
   - Renumbered all remaining tasks (Task 2 → Task 1, etc.)

5. **Enhanced task descriptions** with "BEFORE WRITING ANY TESTS":
   - Added specific documentation links for each task
   - Added "Read docs first!" reminders for each untested function
   - Emphasized testing in `nix repl` before writing code

6. **Restructured "After Runtime Testing" section**:
   - Renamed to "What Remains AFTER Runtime Testing"
   - Changed from achievements to missing implementations
   - Added explicit warning: "DO NOT START UNTIL 80% COVERAGE"
   - Listed specific documentation links for each missing feature

The prompt.md file now actively enforces the rules and will help keep the other bot focused on:
- Testing the 69 untested runtime builtins (Tasks 1-5 for 80% coverage)
- Reading documentation before implementing
- Following the work order strictly
- Breaking down tasks without claiming blockers
