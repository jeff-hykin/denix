Perfect! I've completely rewritten the prompt.md file to enforce all the rules you specified:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Added critical rules section at the very top** with:
   - Focus on what's NOT implemented/working
   - Work order: Runtime → Translator → Tests (must follow strictly)
   - Implementation requirements (read docs, use esm.sh, break down tasks)
   - Reminder to create intermediate steps if plan is missing

2. **Removed ALL achievements and checkmarks** (✅):
   - Changed from "What's Working" to "WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE"
   - Removed all positive accomplishment statements
   - Focused only on missing/incomplete work

3. **Added documentation requirements**:
   - "ALWAYS read Nix documentation WHILE implementing" with URL
   - "Search for real-world examples"
   - "Test behavior in `nix repl` first"
   - Specific documentation links in each priority section

4. **Added npm module reminder**:
   - "Use npm modules ONLY via esm.sh" with example syntax
   - Note that esm.sh is unreliable

5. **Enforced the rules myself**:
   - Removed "Current Status Summary" section
   - Removed "Quick Decision Guide" 
   - Removed all celebration/achievement language
   - Restructured to focus on gaps and missing work

6. **Made priorities action-oriented**:
   - Each priority lists what's NOT implemented
   - Clear steps for implementation
   - Documentation to read WHILE working

The document is now 375 lines (down from 427) and purely focused on what remains to be done, with strong enforcement of the work order and implementation requirements.
