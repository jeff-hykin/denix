Perfect! Now let me create a final summary of what I've done:

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the Denix runtime testing status and updated all documentation with accurate information.

### Key Findings (Session 34):

**ACCURATE BUILTIN COUNT**:
- **109 function builtins** (not 97 as previously documented)
- **40 tested (37% coverage)** - down from claimed 41%
- **69 untested (63%)** - more work than expected

### What I Updated:

1. **prompt.md** - Corrected with accurate counts:
   - Updated primary goal: 47 tests needed (not 37)
   - Task 1: Type checking is COMPLETE ✅ (all 10 functions tested)
   - Task 2-6: Accurate function lists with tested vs untested
   - Added Tasks 7-10 for remaining functions
   - Time estimates: 17-25 hours to 80% (not 22-31)

2. **MEMORY.md** - Updated session history:
   - Session 34 entry with comprehensive analysis
   - Corrected statistics (109 builtins, 40 tested, 69 untested)
   - Updated immediate action plan

3. **TESTING_STATUS.md** - NEW comprehensive report:
   - Complete list of 40 tested builtins by category
   - Complete list of 69 untested builtins with priorities
   - Path to 80% coverage broken into 4 phases
   - Time estimates table
   - Next steps with specific actions

### Critical Discovery:

**Type checking is DONE!** All 10 type checking functions (isNull, isBool, isInt, isFloat, isString, isList, isPath, isAttrs, typeOf, isFunction) already have test coverage. This saves 3-4 hours.

### Path Forward:

To reach 80% coverage (87/109 tested):
- **Phase 1**: List operations (16 functions, 8-12 hours)
- **Phase 2**: String operations (5 functions, 3-4 hours)
- **Phase 3**: Math & path/file (15 functions, 6-9 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Final 11 functions (5-7 hours)
- **Total: 22-32 hours (3-4 days)**

### Most Critical Untested Functions:
1. **map** - Most used list function with lazyMap proxy
2. **filter** - Second most used list function
3. **all/any** - Core list predicates
4. **getAttr/attrNames/attrValues** - Core attrset operations

**Next immediate action**: Start Task 2 - Create `main/tests/builtins_lists_test.js` to test 10 list operations (5-7 hours).
