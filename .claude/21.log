Excellent! I've successfully completed Phases 1-3 of the import system implementation:

## ✅ **Completed: Import System Phases 1-3**

### Phase 1: Path Resolution ✅
- `tools/import_resolver.js` (120 lines)
- 16 tests passing

### Phase 2: Import Cache ✅  
- `main/import_cache.js` (95 lines)
- 12 tests passing
- Circular dependency detection working

### Phase 3: File Loader ✅
- `main/import_loader.js` (134 lines)
- 7 tests passing
- Handles .nix and .json files
- Proper comment filtering

**Total: 35 new tests, all passing!**

### Next: Phase 4 - Runtime Integration

The next step is to integrate these components into `main/runtime.js` to implement `builtins.import` and `builtins.scopedImport`. This will enable the translator to actually load external .nix files.

Would you like me to proceed with Phase 4 (Runtime Integration), or would you prefer to review the current implementation first?
