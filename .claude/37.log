Perfect! I've significantly enhanced the prompt.md with much more detail about what remains to be done. Let me create a summary of the improvements I made:

## Summary

I've reviewed the current state of the Denix project and **added significant detail** to prompt.md about remaining work. The file now contains:

### Key Additions:

1. **Store Path System (Section 1.1)** - Added:
   - Research tasks for NAR format and fixed-output derivation paths
   - Specific Deno API references (crypto.subtle.digest, Deno.rename)
   - Fallback strategy (~/.cache/denix/store)
   - Store path fingerprint format details
   - Note about reusing existing tools/store_path.js code

2. **fetchurl Implementation (Section 1.2)** - Added:
   - Specific implementation details for each task
   - Retry logic timing (1s, 2s, 4s exponential backoff)
   - Stream download approach using ReadableStream
   - Hash verification methods
   - Parameter handling details

3. **fetchTarball Implementation (Section 1.3)** - Added:
   - Research section for finding tar libraries
   - Critical note about NAR hashing algorithm
   - Deterministic directory hashing requirements
   - Fallback to tar CLI via Deno.Command
   - Auto-detection of compression formats

4. **Examples Directory (Section 2)** - Added:
   - Detailed file-by-file breakdown with descriptions
   - Specific extraction sources from existing tests
   - verify_examples.js script specification
   - Detailed README.md content outline
   - Comments about key translation patterns to explain

5. **nixpkgs.lib Testing (Section 3)** - Added:
   - Reorganized 19 remaining files by difficulty/dependencies
   - Specific test validation criteria for each file
   - Priority ordering (easy wins first)
   - Complexity estimates (simple, medium, complex, multi-week)

6. **Performance & Optimization (Section 4)** - Added:
   - Specific profiling techniques and tools
   - Concrete optimization strategies with trade-offs
   - Benchmark methodology
   - Expected performance targets

7. **Documentation (Section 5)** - Added:
   - Specific file names and content outlines (LIMITATIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SCOPES.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
   - Target locations in code for inline comments
   - Common error patterns and solutions

8. **New Section 6 - Maintenance & Infrastructure**:
   - README.md updates needed (outdated counts)
   - CI/CD pipeline suggestions
   - Contributor guide outline

9. **Enhanced Summary Section**:
   - Reorganized into Priority 0-5
   - Added time estimates for each priority
   - Added "Quick Wins" section (1-2 hours)
   - Added "Suggested First Steps" with specific 15-minute tasks

The prompt.md now contains **actionable, detailed tasks** with no accomplishment reporting - only what remains to be done.
