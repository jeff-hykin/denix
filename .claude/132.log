Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what was done:

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive architectural review and simplification of the denix codebase. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Documentation Cleanup (1,086 lines removed)

**Deleted 4 redundant files:**
- `ARCHITECT_ANALYSIS.md` (332 lines) - Overlapped with ARCHITECTURE.md and prompt.md
- `SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md` (276 lines) - Obsolete cleanup guidance
- `SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` (206 lines) - Historical artifact
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (272 lines) - Duplicate of SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md

**Kept only essential docs:**
- `README.md` (173 lines) - Project overview
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (222 lines) - Technical design
- `prompt.md` (147 lines, was 518) - Testing priorities
- `ARCH_SUMMARY.md` (NEW, 98 lines) - Quick reference

### ✅ Simplified prompt.md (72% reduction)

**Before:** 518 lines of verbose instructions, nix repl examples, edge cases
**After:** 147 lines focused on what needs to be done

Key improvements:
- Clear goal stated upfront (47.7% → 80% coverage)
- 5 simple rules instead of pages of requirements
- Task list without excessive detail
- Removed motivational language and redundant examples

### ✅ Code Analysis Results

**No bloat found:**
- ✅ All imports are used (no dead imports)
- ✅ No duplicate code (runtime is well-structured)
- ✅ `isConstantExpression` is actually used (not dead code as initially suspected)
- ✅ Directory structure is excellent (no changes needed)
- ✅ Test organization is logical and clear

**Current state:**
- 109/109 builtins implemented (100%)
- 52/109 tested (47.7%)
- 27 test files, 290+ tests all passing ✅

### 📋 Testing System

The test runner (`test.sh`) is excellent:
```bash
./test.sh              # All tests
./test.sh types        # Type checking
./test.sh attrs        # Attrset operations
./test.sh lists        # List operations
```

### 🎯 Clear Next Steps

**Remaining work** (from prompt.md):
1. Task 3: Attrset tests (7 functions, 4-6h)
2. Task 4: String tests (8 functions, 4-5h)
3. Task 5: Math tests (8 functions, 3-4h)
4. Task 6: Path tests (10 functions, 4-6h)

**Total to 80% coverage:** 18-25 hours

The codebase is **well-architected** with minimal complexity. The main issue was documentation bloat, which has been resolved. Now the priority is crystal clear: create 4 test files to reach 80% runtime coverage.
