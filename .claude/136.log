Perfect! Let me create a brief summary of what was changed:

## Summary

I've successfully edited `prompt.md` to enforce the rules and keep the other bot on track. Here's what I changed:

### ✅ Added Critical Instructions Header (lines 3-46)
- **Clear mandate**: Focus only on what's NOT implemented/working
- **Work order enforcement**: Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs.lib tests (MUST follow sequence)
- **Implementation guidelines**: Always read Nix documentation first
- **NPM modules reminder**: Use esm.sh but it's unreliable

### ✅ Removed All Achievements
- Changed "Current State" to "Current State - What Remains"
- Removed checkmarks (✅) and "PASSING" statements
- Changed "Session 40 Findings: ✅ CLEAN AND WELL-ORGANIZED" to neutral "Code Organization Notes"
- Removed test counts like "87/87 tests passing (100%)"
- Changed "already complete" to neutral language

### ✅ Added Documentation Links
- Added Nix documentation URLs to all 4 tasks
- Added derivation documentation links to Priority 0
- Emphasized reading docs BEFORE implementing

### ✅ Strengthened Testing Guidelines
1. Read Nix documentation FIRST (with URL)
2. Test in nix repl SECOND
3. Write 5+ tests per function
4. Compare against Nix
5. Fix bugs immediately

### Key Changes:
- **Line 3-46**: New critical instructions section
- **Line 37-46**: Current state shows ONLY what remains to fix
- **Line 66-69**: Added documentation links for derivations
- **Line 88-93**: Added documentation links for math/bitwise functions
- **Line 102-108**: Added documentation links for attrset operations
- **Line 116-124**: Added documentation links for string operations
- **Line 132-140**: Added documentation links for path/file operations
- **Line 221-226**: Enhanced testing best practices with doc-first approach
- **Line 232-236**: Removed achievement language from "What NOT to Do"

The prompt.md now strictly enforces the work order, removes all achievement reporting, and constantly reminds the bot to read Nix documentation before implementing anything.
