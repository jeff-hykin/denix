Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the changes I made to show to you:

## Summary: prompt.md Updated to Enforce Work-Focused Behavior

I've updated the prompt.md file to enforce the rules you specified. Here are the key changes:

### ✅ Added at the Top (New Section)
**"FOR THE AI AGENT: YOUR CORE BEHAVIOR"** - A prominent section that explicitly tells the bot to:
- Scan for and DELETE achievements (✅, "completed", "done", etc.)
- Focus ONLY on remaining work
- Never report successes or celebrations
- Update the file to remove completed tasks
- Example: "After completing fetchTree, silently delete it from the list and move to next task"

### ✅ Strengthened Existing Rules
1. **NO ACHIEVEMENTS rule** - Now explicitly says to DELETE lines with ✅, "completed", "done", "working", "passing"
2. **NO BLOCKERS rule** - Added example of breaking down dependencies into sequential tasks
3. **DOCUMENTATION FIRST rule** - Added mandatory note-taking step with specific questions to answer
4. **NPM/ESM.SH usage** - Added concrete code examples (simple-git, tar, node-fetch)

### ✅ Enhanced Documentation Reminders
- Added 3 complete examples (fetchGit, fetchTarball, fetchTree) showing the EXACT documentation reading process
- Emphasized reading the COMPLETE PAGE, not just a quick glance
- Added specific URLs for each builtin

### ✅ Stronger Warning Language
- Changed "Do NOT proceed" → "⛔ DO NOT PROCEED ⛔"
- Added "NON-NEGOTIABLE" labels
- Added warning: "IF YOU START CODING WITHOUT READING THE DOCS, YOU WILL WASTE HOURS"

### ✅ Cleaned Up Status Section
Removed achievement language like "57% done so far" - now just says "3 fetchers remain"

### Result
The prompt.md now:
- **Forces the bot to focus on GAPS and REMAINING WORK only**
- **Explicitly forbids achievement reporting**
- **Requires documentation reading with specific note-taking steps**
- **Provides concrete examples of npm module usage via esm.sh**
- **Enforces the work order: Runtime → Translator → Tests**

The bot should now stay focused on completing the 3-4 remaining builtins without celebrating or documenting past achievements!
