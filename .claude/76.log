Perfect! Now I have successfully edited the prompt.md file to enforce all the rules requested. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## Summary

I've successfully edited `/Users/jeffhykin/repos/denix/prompt.md` to enforce the coaching rules you specified:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Strong enforcement header** (lines 1-35):
   - Clear "CRITICAL RULES" section at the very top
   - 5 absolute rules that MUST be followed
   - Removed soft language, made everything directive
   - Added RULE 4: Never add checkmarks or achievements to this file
   - Added RULE 5: Break down blockers instead of claiming they exist

2. **Removed achievement-focused sections**:
   - Removed "Current Status Summary" with checkmarks
   - Replaced with "REMAINING WORK" sections focusing only on what's NOT done
   - Changed from "✅ X implemented" to "❌ X not implemented"

3. **Added mandatory documentation requirements** (lines 37-77, 959-985):
   - Created "MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS" section
   - Added 5-step process that MUST be followed before coding
   - Added "MANDATORY BEFORE CODING" checklists for each task
   - Added "DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (READ WHILE WORKING)" section at end
   - Included citation requirement for implementations

4. **Strengthened enforcement language**:
   - Changed "Before starting: Read..." to "MANDATORY BEFORE CODING:"
   - Changed "DO NOT" to "NEVER" with "(VIOLATIONS WILL BE REJECTED)"
   - Made all rules absolute with no wiggle room

5. **Documentation links at every task**:
   - Task 1 (fetchTree path): Links to Noogle + specific guidance
   - Task 2 (fetchMercurial): 5-point checklist including Noogle, comparison with fetchGit
   - Task 3 (fetchClosure): 6-point checklist including protocol docs, NAR format, testing
   - Task 4 (getFlake): 7-point checklist including flake manual, lock format, input resolution
   - Task 5 (fetchTree indirect): 5-point checklist including registry format

6. **Added esm.sh reminder** (line 66-68):
   - Noted that npm modules can be used via https://esm.sh/
   - Added warning that esm.sh is unreliable
   - Recommended Deno @std/* when possible

The prompt.md file now acts as a strict coach that:
- Forces documentation reading before ANY coding
- Removes all achievement language
- Makes work order absolute and non-negotiable
- Breaks down tasks clearly
- Reminds about Noogle/Nix manual at every implementation task
