Excellent! The prompt.md has been updated with strong enforcement rules. Let me create a summary document for you:

## Summary

I've successfully updated `prompt.md` to keep the other bot on track with these key changes:

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Added Prime Directive at the top** (lines 5-6):
   - Focus ONLY on what's NOT implemented/working
   - No achievement reporting
   - Senior developer mindset (no blockers)

2. **Added Mandatory Work Order** (lines 8-11):
   - Runtime FIRST (finish network fetchers + store functions)
   - Translator SECOND (only after runtime 100% complete)
   - nixpkgs tests THIRD (only after translator complete)

3. **Added "BEFORE IMPLEMENTING ANYTHING" section** (lines 13-18):
   - ALWAYS read Nix docs FIRST
   - Test in `nix repl` to verify behavior
   - Read → Test → Implement (in that order)

4. **Added External Dependencies section** (lines 20-24):
   - Only use npm via esm.sh
   - Warning that esm.sh is unreliable
   - Prefer Deno standard library

5. **Added "WHEN WRITING THIS DOCUMENT" section** (lines 26-31):
   - Instructions to remove all ✅ checkboxes (achievements)
   - Remove "Completed" sections
   - Focus only on gaps/missing features

6. **Replaced "PROJECT STATUS" with "WHAT'S NOT DONE"** (lines 47-67):
   - Removed all achievement statements
   - Listed only gaps and missing features
   - Clear focus on what needs work

7. **Removed "PRIORITY 0: COMPLETED" section**:
   - Deleted entire section (was lines 39-47)
   - No achievements in the document

8. **Enhanced WORK ORDER section** (lines 337-353):
   - Explicit "DO NOT SKIP" warnings
   - Clear reasoning for the order

9. **Added "IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW" section** (lines 407-437):
   - 5-step mandatory process for every feature
   - Read docs → Test in repl → Write test → Implement → Verify
   - Explicit "DO NOT skip steps" warning

10. **Enhanced all Priority 5 tasks** with documentation links:
    - Added "Read documentation FIRST" with specific URLs
    - Added "Test in nix repl" reminders

### 🎯 Key Enforcement Mechanisms

The updated prompt.md now:
- **Opens with rules** (not buried in middle)
- **Explicitly forbids** achievement reporting
- **Mandates work order** (runtime → translator → tests)
- **Requires documentation reading** before coding
- **Provides 5-step workflow** for every implementation
- **Focuses entirely on gaps**, not accomplishments

The bot should now stay focused on remaining work and follow the proper sequence!
