Excellent! The document is complete and well-structured. Now let me create a brief summary of what was accomplished in this session and what remains:

## Summary

I've successfully reviewed and updated the `prompt.md` document with accurate current state information and additional implementation details. The document has grown from 750 lines to **896 lines** (+146 lines, 20% increase).

### Key Updates Made:

1. **Corrected Current State**:
   - Fixed nixpkgs.lib test coverage: Was stated as 15/32 (47%), actually **10/41 files (24%)**
   - Listed all 10 tested files and 31 remaining files
   - Verified runtime is 62/65 builtins (95% complete)

2. **Added Quick Navigation**:
   - "Quick Start" section at top with immediate next task
   - "Current Status Summary" for quick reference
   - Enhanced work priority order with specific steps

3. **Enhanced Translator Edge Cases Section** (Phase 1):
   - Added 5 detailed subsections (was 4)
   - Documented `<nixpkgs>` partial implementation (line 149 in main.js)
   - Added multi-line strings, URI literals, inherit expressions
   - Added operator precedence verification tasks

4. **Added New Testing Priorities**:
   - Runtime builtin edge cases (complex regex, version comparisons, JSON handling)
   - Import system edge cases (circular imports, caching behavior, relative paths)
   - Additional testing needs section

5. **Improved Organization**:
   - Clear decision tree after Task 1
   - Specific line numbers and file references
   - Time estimates for all tasks
   - Quick reference commands section

### What Remains to be Done:

**IMMEDIATE (1-2 hours):**
- Task 1: Implement `fetchTree type='path'` (runtime.js line 1290)

**Then choose one path:**
- **Option A** (16-22 days): Implement 3 optional builtins (fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake)
- **Option B** (2-3 days, RECOMMENDED): Verify translator edge cases + expand nixpkgs.lib testing

The document now provides comprehensive guidance for all remaining work with accurate current state information.
