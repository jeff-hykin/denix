Perfect! Now let me create a summary for you:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

I've successfully enforced the rules you specified:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added a prominent "STOP! READ THIS FIRST" section** at the very top with 7 critical rules, including:
   - Focus ONLY on what is NOT done
   - Remove all checkboxes (✅) and completed items
   - Follow work order strictly: Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs tests
   - Read documentation BEFORE and WHILE implementing
   - Test EVERY builtin in `nix repl` before writing code

2. **Enhanced the documentation reading requirements** with:
   - Explicit "MANDATORY: READ DOCUMENTATION" section
   - Step-by-step workflow example for implementing builtins.fetchClosure
   - Links to nix.dev, noogle.dev, and GitHub search
   - Instructions to read Nix source code if needed

3. **Removed all achievement checkboxes** (✅ DONE) from lines 379-381:
   - Deleted "✅ DONE: Test 5 math/bitwise functions"
   - Deleted "✅ DONE: Test 3 attrset functions"
   - Deleted "✅ DONE: Test 5 string functions"
   - Removed "4 hours completed" from time estimate

4. **Removed "✨ NEW" badges** from the test file list (lines 163-165)

5. **Enhanced npm module section** with:
   - Explicit example: `import tar from "https://esm.sh/tar@7.0.0"`
   - Warning that esm.sh is unreliable
   - Preference for Deno standard library

6. **Added mandatory preparation section** before Phase 4 with explicit steps:
   - Open documentation in browser
   - Read docs for EACH function
   - Test in nix repl with multiple inputs
   - Write down exact outputs
   - Search GitHub for examples

### Result:

The prompt.md file now strongly enforces:
- **No achievements or completions** - only remaining work
- **Mandatory documentation reading** - with specific URLs and workflow
- **Strict work order** - Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs tests
- **Breaking down tasks** - no blockers exist
- **Using esm.sh for npm** - with warnings about reliability

The other bot should now have much clearer guidance and stronger enforcement of the rules!
