Perfect! Now let me create a concise summary of what I found and what remains to be done:

## Summary

I've analyzed the Denix codebase and discovered that **Session 40's test coverage count was significantly understated**. Here's the corrected status:

### Key Finding: Test Coverage is Better Than Documented

**Previous claim (Session 40):** 65/109 tested (59.6%), 44 untested  
**Actual status:** 74/109 tested (67.9%), 35 untested  
**Difference:** 9 more builtins ARE tested than documented

### What Remains to Be Done

**To reach 80% coverage (88/109 tested), need only 14 more builtins (3-5 hours):**

1. **Math operations (30 min):** Add `lessThan` and `mul` tests to existing file
2. **File operations (2-3 hours):** Create new test file for 6 file ops (pathExists, readFile, readDir, readFileType, findFile, getEnv)
3. **Miscellaneous (1-2 hours):** Create new test file for 6 functions (toPath, toXML, fromJSON, abort, getAttr, splitVersion)

**Additional 21 untested builtins (optional, 10-15 hours):**
- Context operations (5): getContext, hasContext, appendContext, etc.
- Store operations (4): storePath, toFile, placeholder, outputOf
- Hashing (2): hashString, hashFile
- Derivations (3): derivationStrict, unsafeDiscardOutputDependency, unsafeGetAttrPos
- Control flow (3): break, traceVerbose, genericClosure
- Fetchers (2): fetchMercurial, fetchClosure
- Advanced (2): getFlake, nixPath

### Updated Documentation

I've updated three files with corrected information:

1. **prompt.md** - Corrected coverage to 67.9%, updated priorities, reduced time estimate to 3-5 hours
2. **MEMORY.md** - Added Session 41 entry documenting the discovery
3. **TEST_COVERAGE_STATUS.md** - NEW comprehensive report with complete untested builtin list

All 413 existing tests still pass (100% pass rate). The runtime is much closer to production-ready than previously thought!
