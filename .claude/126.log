Perfect! Everything is clean. Now let me create one final report for the user:

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive architectural analysis and simplification of the denix codebase. Here's what was done:

### Key Simplifications ✅

1. **Cleaned runtime.js imports** (7 lines removed)
   - Removed 100+ unused import symbols
   - Reduced from 8 import lines to 1 line
   - Only imports `zip` which is actually used

2. **Consolidated duplicate code** (4 lines saved)
   - `nixRepr` function was in 2 places
   - Now exported from runtime.js and imported in main.js
   - Single source of truth

3. **Dramatically simplified prompt.md** (329 lines removed)
   - Reduced from 457 lines → 128 lines (72% reduction)
   - Removed verbose instructions, motivational text, redundant examples
   - Now shows clear table of 6 test files to create with time estimates
   - Developer can understand "what's next" in 30 seconds

4. **Deleted obsolete documentation** (360 lines removed)
   - Removed historical artifacts that were confusing
   - Created consolidated reports in their place

### Total Impact

- **~700 lines of bloat removed**
- **95% reduction in imported symbols** (100+ → 1)
- **All tests still passing** ✅
- **No functionality lost**

### Files Created

1. **ARCHITECT_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive architectural assessment with philosophy on simplicity
2. **SIMPLIFICATION_SUMMARY.md** - Complete summary of all changes made

### The Real Priority is Clear Now

The codebase has **ONE GOAL**: Test 40 more builtins to reach 80% coverage (21-28 hours)

**prompt.md now makes this obvious:**
- 6 test files to create
- Clear time estimates
- Simple 4-step process
- No distractions

The simplification makes it much easier for the other bot (or any developer) to understand what needs to be done and execute on it without getting lost in documentation bloat.
