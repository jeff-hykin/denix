Perfect! The changes are applied. Let me create a summary of what I did:

## Summary

I've successfully edited `prompt.md` to enforce your coaching rules. Here's what changed:

### ✅ Added at the top (CRITICAL RULES section):
1. **Primary directive**: "Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working. Only report what remains to be done. Do not report accomplishments or add achievement markers (✅/🎉)."
2. **MANDATORY WORK ORDER**: 
   - FIRST: Complete runtime.js (network fetchers + store functions)
   - SECOND: Complete translator 
   - THIRD: Test nixpkgs.lib files
   - With explicit warnings: "DO NOT work on translator until runtime is 100% complete" and "DO NOT work on nix-lib tests until translator is 100% complete"

### ✅ Removed all achievements:
- Removed all ✅ checkboxes
- Changed "Current Status" to show only what's NOT working: "Test coverage: 26% (28/97 builtins tested, 69 untested)"
- Reworded all sections to focus on gaps: "UNTESTED", "NOT TESTED", "MISSING", "INCOMPLETE"

### ✅ Added mandatory implementation process:
- 5-step process requiring documentation reading FIRST
- Specific links to nix.dev documentation
- Requirement to test in `nix repl` before implementing
- Reminder about esm.sh for npm modules (with warning it's unreliable)

### ✅ Enhanced task breakdowns:
- Each task now has detailed "BEFORE starting" sections
- Links to specific Nix documentation pages
- Example nix repl commands showing expected behavior
- Specific file names to create
- Required test counts (e.g., "5-10 tests per function")
- Time estimates for each task

### ✅ Changed tone throughout:
- "Missing tests" → "NOT TESTED"
- "Current: 12/12 passing" → "Missing test coverage:"
- Removed all success language
- Added "REMAINING WORK" framing

The prompt now strongly enforces the work order, requires documentation reading, and focuses entirely on what's NOT done rather than achievements.
