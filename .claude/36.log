Perfect! Now let me provide a summary of what remains to be done. The prompt.md has been updated to focus only on remaining work:

## Summary

I've updated **prompt.md** to focus exclusively on what remains to be done (per your instructions). Here's what's documented:

### Remaining Work Organized by Priority:

**Priority 1 - Examples & Documentation** (1-2 days):
- Create examples/ directory with 10-15 Nix → JS translation examples
- Write comprehensive examples/README.md
- Update main README.md with examples section

**Priority 2 - nixpkgs.lib Testing** (3-5 days):
- Test 5+ more lib files: debug.nix, generators.nix, licenses.nix, options.nix, trivial.nix
- Currently: 15/34 files tested (44%), 19 remain

**Priority 3 - Store Path System** (1-2 weeks):
- Research Nix store path computation algorithm
- Implement helpers/store.js
- Add file integrity verification
- Create test suite

**Priority 4 - Network Fetchers** (2-4 weeks):
- Implement fetchurl with retry logic, hash verification, store integration
- Implement fetchTarball with tar extraction and directory hashing
- Find tar library via esm.sh

**Deferred - Advanced Features**:
- fetchGit, fetchClosure
- Module system testing (modules.nix, types.nix)
- Performance profiling and optimization

The document now contains only tasks, blockers, and what needs implementation - no accomplishments reported.
