Excellent! All tests still passing. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished in this session:

## Summary

I've successfully completed **Priority 1: Create examples/ directory** from prompt.md. Here's what was delivered:

### Examples Directory (Complete! ✅)

**Created 7 translation examples showing Nix → JavaScript**:
- `01_basics/` - literals, operators, functions (3 examples)
- `02_intermediate/` - let expressions, recursive sets, string interpolation (3 examples) 
- `04_advanced/` - imports (1 example)

**Created comprehensive documentation**:
- `examples/README.md` (218 lines) - Complete guide explaining:
  - How to use the translator
  - 6 key translation patterns (BigInt, scope, getters, closures, interpolation)
  - Common gotchas
  - Current limitations

**Created tooling**:
- `examples/run_example.js` - CLI tool to translate .nix → .js
- `examples/verify_examples.js` - Automated verification (7/7 examples verified ✅)

**Updated project documentation**:
- `README.md` - Added examples section (lines 43-82) with quick example
- `prompt.md` - Removed completed Priority 1, renumbered priorities to 1-4
- `MEMORY.md` - Added Session 20 entry documenting completion

### Testing Status
- ✅ All 73 test suites passing (64 steps)
- ✅ 7/7 examples verified by automated script
- ✅ Examples demonstrate all core translation patterns

### Next Priority (from prompt.md)
**Priority 1**: Test more nixpkgs.lib files (4-6 days)
- Start with easy wins: debug.nix, licenses.nix, cli.nix
- 19/34 lib files remaining to test

The examples are production-ready and provide clear guidance for users to understand how Denix translates Nix expressions to JavaScript!
