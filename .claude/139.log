Perfect! I've updated the prompt.md file to enforce all the rules you specified:

## Changes Made:

1. **Added Critical Instructions at the top** with:
   - Clear mandate to focus on NOT implemented/NOT working items only
   - Strict work order: Runtime → Translator → Nix-lib tests
   - Implementation requirements (read docs, test in nix repl, use esm.sh)
   - 5-step "BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK" checklist

2. **Added section for missing implementation plans**:
   - If a task has no detailed plan, create intermediate steps FIRST
   - Break down into 2-4 hour chunks
   - Document as priority sections

3. **Removed achievement markers**:
   - Changed `✅` to plain text in "Already Tested" section
   - Kept the information but removed celebration markers

4. **Enhanced Rules section**:
   - Separated into "What NOT to do" and "What TO do"
   - Added explicit rule: "Do NOT report achievements or completed work"
   - Added explicit rule: "Do NOT skip reading documentation"
   - Added explicit rule: "Do NOT work on translator before runtime complete"
   - Emphasized reading Nix docs and searching for examples

5. **Emphasized documentation-driven development**:
   - Links to https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/language/builtins.html
   - Requirement to search internet for examples
   - Requirement to test in nix repl first

The prompt now clearly enforces the work order (Runtime → Translator → Tests) and emphasizes documentation-based implementation, while removing all achievement language and focusing only on remaining work.
