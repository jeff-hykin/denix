Excellent! All 206 tests are passing. Now let me create a final summary for the user:

## Summary

I've successfully analyzed and simplified the Denix codebase. Here's what I found and did:

### Key Findings

**Good News - Code is Clean:**
- ✅ Core functionality is well-organized
- ✅ Test structure is logical (28 test files, 206 tests passing)
- ✅ No duplicate code or dead directories
- ✅ Support modules properly separated
- ✅ Simple test runner (`test.sh`) works well

**Problem - Documentation Bloat:**
- ❌ 4 doc files with overlapping information (50KB)
- ❌ `prompt.md` was 828 lines (too long to read)
- ❌ `TESTING.md` duplicated what `test.sh` already explains
- ❌ Inconsistent file naming between docs and test.sh

### Changes Made

**1. Documentation Consolidation (70% reduction):**
- **Deleted** `TESTING.md` (260 lines) - redundant
- **Rewrote** `prompt.md` (828 → 90 lines, 89% reduction)
  - Removed verbose examples, nix repl dumps, motivational text
  - Now: Simple list of 6 test files to create, in order
  - Clear priority: Type checking → Lists → Attrsets → Strings → Math → Paths
- **Updated** stats in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md`

**2. File Naming Consistency:**
- Standardized test file names (comprehensive not abbreviated)
- Updated `test.sh` to match `prompt.md`
- Example: `builtins_type_checking_test.js` not `builtins_types_test.js`

**3. Refocused Priorities:**
- **Clear goal:** 80% runtime test coverage (40/109 → 87/109 builtins)
- **Next action:** Create `main/tests/builtins_type_checking_test.js` (10 functions)
- **Process:** Test in nix repl → Write Deno tests → Run tests → Fix bugs

### What I Did NOT Change

**Code (already good):**
- No changes to runtime.js or main.js
- Left imports as-is (they're all used)
- Test organization unchanged (it's logical)
- Directory structure unchanged (it's clean)

**Why:** Code is fine. Problem was documentation, not implementation.

### New Documentation Structure

```
README.md (5KB)        - What/Why/Quick Start (entry point)
ARCHITECTURE.md (7KB)  - How it works (design decisions)
prompt.md (3KB)        - What to do next (current priorities)
```

Each file has one clear purpose, no overlap.

### The Impact

**Before:**
- 828 lines to read to understand priorities
- Unclear which test file names to use
- Documentation scattered across 4 files

**After:**
- 90 lines to understand priorities
- Clear: Create test file #1, then #2, then #3...
- Each doc has one purpose

### For the Other Bot

The `prompt.md` now clearly states:

1. **Create these 6 test files in order** (with exact names)
2. **Test 50 builtins total** (specific lists for each file)
3. **Goal: 80% coverage** (40/109 → 87/109)
4. **Process: nix repl → Deno tests → run → fix**

No bloat, no confusion, just priorities.

### Files Modified

- ✅ `prompt.md` - Simplified (828→90 lines)
- ✅ `TESTING.md` - Deleted (redundant)
- ✅ `test.sh` - File names match prompt.md
- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Stats corrected (109 builtins, 37% coverage)
- ✅ `README.md` - Stats corrected

All tests still passing: **206 passed, 0 failed** ✅

The codebase is now **simple, focused, and ready for systematic testing**.
