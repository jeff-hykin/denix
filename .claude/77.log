I've read the prompt.md file. It's comprehensive and accurately reflects the current state. The document clearly states I should await user instruction on which path to take (Option A: implement optional builtins, or Option B: translator edge cases).

According to the instructions, I should **only report what remains to be done** and **wait for user instruction** on which path to take.

The current status is:
- **Runtime**: 62/65 builtins implemented (95% complete)
- **Translator**: 87/87 tests passing (production ready)
- **Remaining work**: 3 optional builtins (fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake) + 2 fetchTree edge cases

The document is well-structured with:
- Clear work order rules
- Two main paths forward (Option A: optional builtins, Option B: translator improvements)
- Detailed implementation guides for each remaining builtin
- Comprehensive testing requirements

**What I'm waiting for from you:**

Please choose which path you'd like me to take:

- **Option A (16-22 days)**: Implement remaining optional builtins
  - fetchMercurial (2-3 days)
  - fetchClosure (5-7 days) 
  - getFlake (5-7 days)
  - fetchTree type='indirect' (3-4 days)

- **Option B (2-3 days)**: Translator edge case verification
  - Advanced pattern matching tests
  - String escape sequences verification
  - Path literal edge cases
  - Operator precedence tests
  - Additional language features verification

The document recommends **Option B** since the runtime is effectively complete for most use cases, and these optional builtins are rarely used in practice. Option B would strengthen the translator and expand testing against real nixpkgs.lib code.

Which path would you like me to pursue?
