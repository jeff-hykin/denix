Perfect! Now let me create a concise summary for the user showing what I've done to improve prompt.md:

The prompt.md file has been updated to focus purely on remaining work:

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed accomplishment sections** (lines 865-878)
   - Deleted "What's Already Working" section with checkmarks
   - Deleted "Key Design Decisions Already Made" (kept in context where needed)
   
2. **Reframed test coverage** (section 3)
   - Changed "Files Successfully Tested ✅" → "Files to Skip (already have tests)"
   - Changed focus from celebrating 15 tested files to emphasizing 19 files still need testing

3. **Made language less celebratory** throughout
   - "fully working" → "implemented" (when needed for context)
   - "Successfully tested" → "already have tests"
   - Removed celebration emojis from accomplishment statements

4. **Added Priority 0: URGENT fixes** (new section 0)
   - Detailed breakdown of README.md updates needed (specific line numbers!)
   - Identified error_messages_test.js as actively misleading (recommends deletion)
   - This was hidden in "Priority 0 - Quick Wins" before, now prominent

5. **Added time estimates** to all major sections
   - Priority 0: 30 minutes
   - Priority 1 (Examples): 2-3 days  
   - Priority 2 (Testing): 1 week
   - Priority 3 (Store): 1-2 weeks
   - Priority 4 (Fetchers): 3-5 weeks
   - Priority 5 (Docs/Perf): Deferred

6. **Added maintenance task**: Fix error_messages_test.js
   - File tests stubs instead of real runtime
   - Claims import/scopedImport are unimplemented (false!)
   - Recommendation: Delete the file

The document now strictly follows your instruction: "DO NOT REPORT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE, ONLY REPORT WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE."
