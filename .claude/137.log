Perfect! Now let me write a clear summary of what I've done for the user:

## Summary

I've thoroughly analyzed the current state of the Denix project and updated **prompt.md** with comprehensive, actionable details about what remains to be done. Here's what I found:

### Current Issues Identified

**Priority 0: Critical Derivation Bugs (9/10 tests failing)**
1. **Store path hash bug**: Output names must be added to `env` with empty strings BEFORE computing derivation ATerm (fix at line 1755)
2. **JSON serialization bug**: `builtins.toJSON` crashes when serializing derivation objects because it checks for functions before checking for derivations (fix at line 306-320)

**Priority 1: Test Coverage Gaps (53/109 builtins untested = 48.6%)**
- Need to create 4 new test files covering 28 high-priority builtins
- Estimated 12-16 hours to reach 80% coverage

### What I Added to prompt.md

1. **Quick Start section** - Immediate action items at the very top
2. **Detailed bug fixes** - Exact code changes needed with line numbers
3. **4 detailed task sections** with:
   - Specific functions to test (with runtime.js line numbers)
   - Documentation links for each function
   - Test requirements (5-10 tests per function)
   - Example nix repl commands to validate behavior
   - Time estimates per task
4. **Test file status** - List of 27 existing test files + 4 files that need creation
5. **Common issues & solutions** - Troubleshooting guide
6. **Complete untested builtin list** - All 53 functions categorized by priority

### Ready to Execute

The prompt.md now provides:
- Clear work order (fix bugs → test builtins → done)
- Exact code changes needed for derivation bugs
- Step-by-step process for creating each test file
- Total time estimate: 14-19 hours to 80% coverage

All information focuses on **what remains to be done**, not achievements. Ready for the next agent to continue!
