Perfect! The documentation is now accurate and comprehensive. Let me create a summary of what I've done:

## Summary

I've updated the Denix project documentation with **verified accurate counts** of what remains to be done for runtime testing:

### Key Findings (Using Explore Agent Analysis)

**Actual Runtime Status:**
- **102 function builtins** implemented (not 109 as previously thought)
- **42 builtins tested** (40% coverage, not 37%)
- **60 builtins untested** (60% of runtime needs tests)

### What I Updated

**1. prompt.md (456 lines total):**
- Corrected all builtin counts across 6 tasks
- Added comprehensive **nix repl test examples** for each task showing expected behavior
- Added **edge cases and error conditions** for each function
- Added "Quick Reference" table showing which test files exist vs need to be created
- Updated time estimates: **21-28 hours to reach 80% coverage**

**2. MEMORY.md:**
- Updated Session 37 entry with verified counts
- Corrected from 109 → 102 function builtins
- Corrected from 40 tested (37%) → 42 tested (40%)
- Updated task breakdown with accurate function counts

### 6 Test Files That Need To Be Created

| Priority | Test File | Functions | Time | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------|--------|
| **⚡ Task 1** | `builtins_type_checking_test.js` | 10 type functions | 3-4h | **DOES NOT EXIST** |
| **⚡ Task 2** | `builtins_lists_comprehensive_test.js` | 8 list functions | 5-7h | **DOES NOT EXIST** |
| **⚡ Task 3** | `builtins_attrs_comprehensive_test.js` | 5 attrset functions | 3-5h | **DOES NOT EXIST** |
| Task 4 | `builtins_strings_comprehensive_test.js` | 6 string functions | 3-4h | **DOES NOT EXIST** |
| Task 5 | `builtins_math_comprehensive_test.js` | 8 math functions | 3-4h | **DOES NOT EXIST** |
| Task 6 | `builtins_paths_comprehensive_test.js` | 10 path functions | 4-6h | **DOES NOT EXIST** |

Each task in prompt.md now includes:
- Complete list of functions to test
- nix repl commands showing expected behavior
- Critical edge cases to verify
- Minimum test count requirements
- Step-by-step testing process

### Next Immediate Action

**Create `main/tests/builtins_type_checking_test.js`** (3-4 hours):
1. Open `nix repl` and test each type function
2. Note exact behavior (e.g., `isInt 42` → true, `isInt 42.0` → false)
3. Create Deno test file matching Nix behavior exactly
4. Run tests and fix any bugs in runtime.js
5. Verify all 50+ tests pass

The documentation now provides **complete, actionable guidance** with no guesswork needed.
