Perfect! Now let me create a summary document of my findings for the user:

## Summary

I've analyzed the current state of the Denix runtime and corrected the documentation in `prompt.md`. Here's what remains to be done:

### Key Corrections Made (Session 40)

**Test Coverage is BETTER than claimed:**
- **Actual: 60/110 builtins tested (54.5% coverage)**
- Previous claim: 56/109 tested (51.4%)
- **4 more functions are tested than Session 39 claimed**
- **50 untested** (not 53)

**Derivation Tests:**
- **9/10 tests FAILING** (not 8/10)
- 2 bugs identified with clear fixes:
  1. Store path hash mismatch (empty output placeholders needed)
  2. toJSON crashes on derivations (function type check before derivation check)

**Test Coverage by Category:**
- ✅ **100% coverage:** Type checking (10/10 functions)
- ✅ **83% coverage:** Fetch operations (5/6)
- ✅ **75% coverage:** Attrset operations (9/12)
- ⚠️ **0% coverage:** Context operations (0/6)
- ⚠️ **0% coverage:** Store/config operations (0/5)
- ⚠️ **25% coverage:** Math & bitwise (2/8)

### Updated Priorities in prompt.md

**Priority 0 (1-2h):** Fix 2 derivation bugs
**Priority 1 (2-3h):** Test 5 math/bitwise functions (ceil, floor, bitAnd, bitOr, bitXor)
**Priority 2 (1-2h):** Test 3 attrset functions (attrNames, attrValues, catAttrs)
**Priority 3 (2-3h):** Test 5 string functions (toString, split, concatStringsSep, baseNameOf, dirOf)
**Priority 4 (3-4h):** Test 11 context/store functions (0% coverage areas)
**Priority 5 (3-4h):** Test 10 remaining high-value functions

**Total time to 75% coverage:** 11-16 hours (Priorities 0-3)
**Total time to 80% coverage:** 17-24 hours (Priorities 0-5)

### What's in prompt.md Now

- ✅ Corrected test coverage statistics
- ✅ Accurate function counts per priority
- ✅ Clear nix repl test examples for each function
- ✅ Removed incorrect claims (sub/mul are operators, already tested)
- ✅ Identified which functions ARE tested vs NOT tested
- ✅ Added complete appendix of all 50 untested builtins
- ✅ Realistic time estimates based on actual work remaining

The documentation now reflects the ACTUAL current state, not an outdated or pessimistic view.
