Perfect! Now let me create a summary for the user:

## Summary

I've reviewed the current state of the Denix project and updated the task documentation:

### Current System Status ✅
- **Translator**: 87/87 tests passing - PRODUCTION READY
- **Runtime**: 61/98 Nix 2.18 builtins working, 170+ tests passing
- **Import system**: Fully functional (builtins.import + builtins.scopedImport)
- **Examples**: 7 translation examples with documentation
- **Tests**: All 73 tests passing (when run with `--allow-all` flag)

### Progress on nixpkgs.lib Testing
- **Current**: 12/32 core lib files tested (37.5%)
- **Target**: 20/32 files (62%) before moving to infrastructure work

### Updated prompt.md

Restored the comprehensive task breakdown (377 lines) with:

**Priority 1** (NEXT): Test more nixpkgs.lib files (1-2 weeks)
- Phase 1: Test systems/*.nix files (parse, inspect, doubles, default) → 50% coverage
- Phase 2: Test utility files (meta, debug, generators, cli, derivations, filesystem) → 69% coverage  
- Phase 3: Complex files with lib dependencies (deferred)

**Priority 2**: Store Path System (1-2 weeks)
- Research NAR format and fixed-output derivation paths
- Implement helpers/store.js with path computation and verification
- Testing and documentation

**Priority 3**: Network Fetchers (3-5 weeks)
- fetchurl implementation (1-2 weeks)
- fetchTarball implementation (2-3 weeks)
- Other fetch functions (future)

**Priority 4-5**: Performance optimization and documentation (deferred)

### Next Immediate Actions

The next concrete tasks are in Priority 1, Phase 1:
1. Test systems/parse.nix (1-2 hours)
2. Test systems/inspect.nix (30 min)
3. Test systems/doubles.nix (15 min)
4. Test systems/default.nix (30 min)

**Goal**: Get from 12 → 16 files tested (50% coverage) in one focused session.

All remaining work is now documented in prompt.md with time estimates, dependencies, and implementation strategies.
