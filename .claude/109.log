Excellent! The prompt.md is now properly structured. Let me create a summary of the changes I made:

## Summary: prompt.md Coaching Enforcement Complete

I've successfully updated the **prompt.md** file to enforce the coaching rules you specified. Here are the key changes:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added CRITICAL RULES section at the top** (lines 2-11)
   - Explicit instruction: "focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working"
   - Clear work order: Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs.lib
   - No blocker mentality enforcement

2. **Added IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY section** (lines 13-30)
   - Mandatory steps: Read Nix 2.18 docs FIRST
   - Use noogle.dev and search for documentation
   - Test in nix repl before implementing
   - Can use npm modules via esm.sh (with warning about reliability)
   - Break down tasks, no blockers allowed

3. **Added IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP section** (lines 38-47)
   - Clear starting point: Task 1 (Type Checking)
   - Specific documentation links
   - Step-by-step process with example nix repl commands

4. **Removed ALL achievement language**
   - No checkboxes (✅)
   - No "completed", "working", "success" descriptions
   - Only "NOT CREATED", "NOT STARTED", "UNTESTED" language

5. **Restructured task descriptions** (lines 51-158)
   - Each task clearly marked as "untested"
   - Documentation links for every category
   - Time estimates per task
   - Required test counts specified

6. **Separated future work** (lines 209-244)
   - Clear "DO NOT START YET" warnings
   - Phase 2: Translator (NOT STARTED)
   - Phase 3: nixpkgs.lib (NOT STARTED)
   - Phase 4: Optional builtins (NOT STARTED, LOW PRIORITY)

### Document Structure:
- **Lines 1-30:** Rules and methodology enforcement
- **Lines 32-47:** Current priority and immediate next step
- **Lines 49-158:** Detailed task breakdown (10 tasks)
- **Lines 160-207:** Test file requirements and missing files
- **Lines 209-244:** Future phases (blocked until runtime complete)
- **Lines 246-257:** Quick reference

The other bot should now have **clear, unambiguous instructions** that:
- Focus only on remaining work
- Require reading Nix documentation before implementing
- Follow the strict work order (runtime → translator → nixpkgs.lib)
- Break down tasks into manageable pieces
- Have no excuses for blockers
