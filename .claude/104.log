Excellent! The file has grown to 1008 lines. Let me create a final summary document:

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the Denix runtime and enhanced the documentation with critical findings. Here's what remains to be done:

### Critical Discovery: Runtime is Broken

Through code review and actual testing, I found **3 confirmed bugs in 3 tested functions** (100% failure rate):

1. **concatLists** (line 559) - ReferenceError crash due to variable name typo
2. **isAttrs** (line 186) - TypeError crash on null/undefined inputs  
3. **head** (line 573) - Logic bug returning `[element]` instead of `element`

### Remaining Work

**Immediate (1 hour):**
- Fix 3 confirmed bugs
- Write regression tests

**Priority 0 (30-46 hours):**
- Test 69 untested functions (74% of runtime)
- Expect to find 20-30 additional bugs
- Categories: Type checking, list ops, attrset ops, strings, math, control flow, paths, hashing, etc.

**Total: 75-138 hours (9-17 days)**

### Documentation Enhanced

**prompt.md** (460 → 1008 lines, +548 lines):
- Added critical warning section at top
- Documented 3 confirmed bugs with test results
- Identified 12 additional suspected issues
- Enhanced all testing task sections with specific bug predictions
- Added test file templates and methodology
- Updated time estimates (increased 40% for bug fixing)
- Added quick reference tables for bugs and priorities

**MEMORY.md** updated:
- Changed status from "100% feature complete" to "NOT PRODUCTION READY"
- Added all bug details
- Updated immediate priorities

### Key Insights

- 26% test coverage is dangerous - untested code contains bugs
- Bug patterns: variable typos, missing null checks, wrong return types, copy-paste errors
- Most critical functions (map, filter, hasAttr, getAttr) still untested
- Testing is not verification - it's **bug discovery**

The runtime cannot be trusted for production use until testing reaches 80%+ coverage.
