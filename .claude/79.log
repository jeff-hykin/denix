Perfect! Now let me provide a summary to the user:

## Summary: Coaching Session Complete ✅

I've edited **prompt.md** to enforce the rules you specified. Here's what changed:

### ✅ Rules Enforced at Top:
1. **"Focus on what's NOT done"** - Already there, reinforced with "filter out achievements" instruction
2. **Work order mandated**:
   - ❶ Finish runtime (network fetchers + store functions)
   - ❷ Finish translator (only after runtime 100%)
   - ❸ Test nixpkgs.lib (only after translator 100%)
3. **"ALWAYS READ DOCUMENTATION"** section added with 5-step process:
   - Read nix.dev official docs
   - Read noogle.dev community docs
   - Search for examples
   - Test in real Nix
   - Base on docs, not assumptions
4. **Reminded about esm.sh** for npm packages (unreliable but allowed)

### ✅ Achievements Removed/Reframed:
- Removed ✅ checkboxes and celebratory language
- Changed "All core functionality working" → "3 builtins not implemented"
- Changed "Production ready" → "Edge cases not verified"
- Reframed all status as "what's missing" not "what's done"

### ✅ Detailed Task Breakdowns Added:
- **Priority 2 (Runtime)**: 4 tasks with steps, docs links, time estimates
  - fetchMercurial (2-3 days)
  - fetchClosure (5-7 days, marked COMPLEX)
  - getFlake (5-7 days, marked VERY COMPLEX)
  - fetchTree type='indirect' (3-4 days)
- **Priority 3 (Translator)**: 5 edge case categories with test file locations
- **Priority 4 (Testing)**: 31 remaining nixpkgs.lib files listed by priority

### ✅ Documentation Emphasis:
Every task now says "Read documentation first" with specific nix.dev and noogle.dev URLs.

The bot should now:
1. Fix derivation tests first (Priority 1)
2. Follow work order strictly (runtime → translator → tests)
3. Read Nix documentation before implementing anything
4. Break large tasks into smaller ones
5. Only report what's NOT done
