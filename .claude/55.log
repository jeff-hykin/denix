Excellent! The prompt.md has been enhanced from 342 lines to 674 lines with comprehensive implementation guidance. Now let me create a summary of what was added:

## Summary

I've reviewed and significantly enhanced the `prompt.md` file to provide comprehensive implementation guidance for the remaining Nix runtime features. Here's what was updated:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added Quick Status Overview Table** (lines 18-31)
   - Clear visualization of all 10 remaining items
   - Priority levels and time estimates
   - Current progress: 62/98 builtins (63%)

2. **Clarified Recent Completion** (lines 33-43)
   - Documented that `fetchTarball` is COMPLETE ✅
   - Listed all working infrastructure modules
   - Confirmed 6/6 tests passing

3. **Enhanced Implementation Guidance** for each builtin:
   - **fetchurl**: 60+ lines of detailed code template showing exactly how to implement it (similar to fetchTarball but simpler)
   - **builtins.path**: 80+ lines with complete recursive directory copy algorithm, filter support, and NAR hashing
   - **toJSON**: Simple 5-line fix clearly documented

4. **Added Technical Reference Sections**:
   - Available Infrastructure with function signatures
   - Hash format normalization rules
   - Store path structure details
   - Caching behavior patterns
   - Error handling best practices
   - Filter function interface specification
   - Performance considerations
   - Platform-specific differences

5. **Added Testing Strategy Section** (60+ lines):
   - Test file naming conventions
   - Required test case types
   - Test structure patterns
   - Coverage goals
   - Completion criteria

### What Remains to be Done (9 items):

**IMMEDIATE** (30 minutes):
1. ✅ toJSON for Path objects - Simple 5-line fix

**HIGH PRIORITY** (3-4 days):
2. ❌ fetchurl - 1-2 days (template provided)
3. ❌ path - 1-2 days (template provided)
4. ❌ filterSource - 1 day (wrapper around path)

**MEDIUM/LOW PRIORITY** (2-4 weeks):
5. ❌ fetchGit - 1-2 weeks (requires git binary)
6. ❌ fetchTree - 1 week (delegates to other fetchers)
7. ❌ fetchMercurial - 1 week (rarely used)

**DEFER**:
8. ❌ fetchClosure - Very complex (experimental)
9. ❌ getFlake - Extremely complex (not critical)

The document now provides everything needed to implement the remaining builtins, with working code templates that can be copied almost directly into runtime.js.
