## Architectural Cleanup Complete ✅

I've successfully simplified and organized the denix codebase. Here's what I did:

### 1. **Deleted Redundant Documentation** (246 lines removed)
- ❌ `ARCH_SUMMARY.md` (101 lines) - was just a one-page summary of other files
- ❌ `CODEBASE_STATUS.md` (145 lines) - duplicated ARCHITECTURE.md content

### 2. **Streamlined prompt.md** (968 → 166 lines, **83% reduction**)
- Removed 800+ lines of verbose test examples and instructions
- **Clear Priority 0: Fix derivation bugs FIRST** (blocking everything else)
- Simple 4-tier priority system with time estimates
- Each priority is 1 paragraph, not 150 lines

### 3. **Updated Documentation** 
**3 files remain, 540 total lines** (was 5 files, ~1450 lines):
- `README.md` (174 lines) - User guide + current status
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (200 lines) - Technical design decisions only
- `prompt.md` (166 lines) - Clear priorities and next actions

### 4. **Verified Codebase Health**
✅ **No architectural issues found:**
- No dead code
- No duplicate implementations  
- Clear separation of concerns (translator vs runtime)
- Simple test organization (27 test files, 415+ tests passing)

### Key Findings:

**The codebase is CLEAN and SIMPLE.** No refactoring needed.

**Main work is EXECUTION, not design:**
1. 🐛 Fix 2 derivation bugs (1-2h) - **exact fixes documented in prompt.md**
2. 📝 Add tests for 31 critical functions (12-16h)
3. 🎯 Total to 80% coverage: ~15-20 hours

**Critical Priority:** The derivation bugs (8/10 tests failing) must be fixed FIRST. Both bugs have exact line numbers and code snippets in prompt.md.

The simplified documentation makes it crystal clear what needs to be done next. No bloat, no confusion, just actionable priorities.
