Perfect! I've completely rewritten the prompt.md file to enforce all the rules you specified:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Added CRITICAL RULES section at the top** with your exact wording:
   - "Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working..."
   - Clear work order: Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs.lib tests
   - Implementation guidelines emphasizing reading Nix docs and using esm.sh
   - 5-step process before starting any task

2. **Removed ALL achievements and checkboxes (✅)**:
   - Changed "109/109 builtins implemented ✅" to "53/109 builtins have NO tests"
   - Changed "87/87 translator tests passing ✅" to "Unknown edge cases not yet discovered"
   - Removed all positive language about what's working
   - Focused entirely on what's FAILING or MISSING

3. **Emphasized documentation usage**:
   - Added links to nix.dev documentation in every section
   - Required reading docs BEFORE implementing
   - Required testing in `nix repl` BEFORE writing code
   - Added "MUST READ BEFORE IMPLEMENTING" section at bottom

4. **Reminded about esm.sh for npm modules**:
   - Noted it's the only way to use npm modules
   - Warned that it's unreliable

5. **Enhanced bug fix sections**:
   - Added explicit "Read https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.28/language/derivations.html" instruction
   - Explained WHY each fix is needed (root cause analysis)
   - Provided exact verification steps

6. **Structured remaining work clearly**:
   - Priority 0-6 showing what's NOT done
   - Each section starts with "Problem:" to highlight what's broken/missing
   - Time estimates for each task
   - Clear test requirements

The prompt now strictly enforces:
- No achievements or celebration
- Work must follow the order: Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs tests
- Must read documentation before implementing
- Break down tasks into smaller pieces
- Focus only on what remains to be done
