Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the changes I made:

## Summary

I've successfully edited prompt.md to strictly enforce your coaching rules. Here are the key changes:

### 1. **Strengthened top instructions**
   - Added explicit "NEVER report accomplishments" 
   - Added "READ THIS FIRST" emphasis on critical work order
   - Added mandatory implementation requirements section with Noogle documentation links
   - Emphasized reading https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/BUILTIN_NAME before ANY implementation

### 2. **Removed ALL achievements** 
   - Deleted "RECENTLY COMPLETED (Session 24)" section
   - Removed "✅ READY TO MOVE TO NEXT PHASE" status
   - Removed "Recommended Next Steps" with checkmarks
   - Removed entire "ACTUAL CURRENT STATUS (Session 24)" section listing accomplishments
   - Removed decision tree with "Runtime complete" branches

### 3. **Simplified to focus on remaining work**
   - Replaced complex decision tree with simple "WORK PRIORITY ORDER" (1. Runtime, 2. Translator, 3. Testing)
   - Changed "RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS" to "IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE" with 5 specific tasks
   - Reorganized tasks by priority (fetchTree type='path' = HIGHEST, others = LOW)
   - Each task now requires reading Noogle docs first

### 4. **Enforced sequential work**
   - Added "DO NOT START UNTIL INSTRUCTED" to translator section
   - Made work order explicit: finish runtime → translator → testing (NO skipping)
   - Added decision point after Task 1 to check with user

### 5. **Emphasized documentation-driven development**
   - Every task starts with "Before starting: Read https://noogle.dev/..."
   - Removed assumptions, added requirement to verify against actual Nix
   - Added example workflow showing documentation-first approach

The document now strictly focuses on **what needs to be done** rather than what was accomplished, and enforces reading official Nix documentation before any implementation work.
