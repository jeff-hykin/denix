Perfect! The prompt.md file has been successfully updated. Now let me create a summary for you:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

I've successfully enforced all the rules you specified:

### ✅ Added CRITICAL RULES at the top:
- **Focus on what's NOT done** - No achievement reporting
- **Work order enforcement** - Runtime → Translator → Testing (must follow sequence)
- **Documentation-first approach** - Always read Nix docs before implementing
- **Break down large tasks** - No task over 1 day without checkpoints

### ✅ Removed all achievements:
- Removed all checkboxes (✅)
- Removed status statements like "165/166 tests passing"
- Removed accomplishment language ("All core features working", "Import system working", etc.)
- Changed descriptions to focus only on what remains

### ✅ Enhanced with documentation reminders:
- Added mandatory documentation reading section
- Listed specific resources: nix.dev, noogle.dev, Nix source code
- Added "Read first" links to every task
- Emphasized testing in `nix repl` before implementing

### ✅ Added npm module guidance:
- Documented esm.sh usage: `https://esm.sh/PACKAGE_NAME`
- Added warning that esm.sh is unreliable
- Recommended Deno standard library when possible

### ✅ Restructured priorities:
- **Priority 1**: Runtime bugs (derivation fix + edge cases)
- **Priority 2**: Optional builtins (decision needed - skip or implement)
  - Detailed breakdowns for fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake with time estimates
  - Research → Implementation → Testing phases
- **Priority 3**: Translator edge cases (AFTER runtime complete)
- **Priority 4**: nixpkgs.lib testing (AFTER translator complete)

### ✅ Added enforcement statements:
- "Do NOT work on translator until runtime complete"
- "Do NOT work on nixpkgs.lib tests until translator complete"
- "Before starting ANY of these, read the documentation"

The prompt.md file now strictly enforces the rules and keeps the other bot focused on what's NOT done, following the correct work order, and reading documentation while implementing.
