Perfect! I've successfully edited the prompt.md file to enforce all the rules you specified. Here's what I did:

## Summary of Changes to prompt.md

### ✅ Added to Top (MANDATORY RULES):
1. **Primary directive**: "Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working. Only report what remains to be done. Do not report what you accomplished."
2. **Senior developer mindset**: "You are a senior level developer, there is no such thing as a blocker. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks."
3. **Filter achievements**: "Before executing what is below, please filter out any achievements. Only keep remaining/unsolved tasks in this document."

### ✅ Enforced Work Order (ABSOLUTE):
- **INSTRUCTIONS section** added prominently at the top:
  - Do NOT work on nix-lib tests until translator is fully implemented
  - Do NOT work on translator until runtime is fully implemented  
  - IN OTHER WORDS: Finish network fetchers and store functions in runtime.js BEFORE doing ANYTHING ELSE
- Made it clear: **YOU ARE IN PHASE 1: RUNTIME IMPLEMENTATION**
- Explicitly forbids touching main.js (translator), nix-lib tests, docs, or examples

### ✅ Removed All Achievements:
- Removed all "93/98 builtins implemented (95% complete)" statements
- Removed "146 tests passing" accomplishments
- Removed "All modules exist" achievement language
- Changed "QUICK STATUS" to "WHAT REMAINS TO IMPLEMENT"
- Removed duplicate sections reporting completed work
- Cleaned up redundant "STOP!" sections with achievement language

### ✅ Enhanced Documentation Requirements:
- Added prominent **"MANDATORY: READ DOCUMENTATION BEFORE CODING"** section
- Emphasized reading https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/<function_name> FIRST
- Added instruction to read https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/language/builtins
- Made it clear: "DO NOT GUESS BEHAVIOR - READ THE DOCS!"
- Stressed that implementations must match Nix behavior exactly

### ✅ Cleaned Up Structure:
- Removed duplicate sections
- Consolidated scattered information
- File reduced from 960 lines to 674 lines (30% reduction)
- Clear hierarchy: Rules → Priorities → Task Details → Reference
- Eliminated redundant reminders and checkboxes

### ✅ Reminded About npm Modules:
- Added note that npm modules are allowed via https://esm.sh/NPM_MODULE_NAME
- Warning that not all npm modules work through esm.sh
- Preference for Deno standard library when available

The prompt.md file now clearly enforces:
1. **Focus on remaining work** (not achievements)
2. **Strict work order** (runtime → translator → nix-lib tests)
3. **Documentation-first approach** (read https://noogle.dev before coding)
4. **Senior developer mindset** (no blockers, break down tasks)
5. **Current task**: Implement builtins.fetchGit (14-16 hours)
