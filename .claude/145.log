Now let me create a final summary message for the user:

Perfect! I've edited prompt.md to enforce your coaching rules. Here's what I changed:

## Key Changes Made:

### 1. **Added Critical Rules Section at Top** ⚠️
- Clear statement: "Focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working"
- Explicit work order: Runtime → Translator → nixpkgs tests
- Mandatory documentation reading process (5 steps)
- NPM module guidance (esm.sh with warnings)

### 2. **Removed All Achievements** 
- Removed "🎉 ALL TESTS PASSING" celebration
- Removed ✅ checkboxes and "Recent Fixes" section
- Changed "What Works (100% tested)" → "Areas with Existing Test Coverage"
- Removed "Architecture verdict" and success language
- Changed "Current State" → "Summary of Remaining Work"

### 3. **Enhanced Work Order Enforcement**
- Added explicit blocking: "DO NOT work on X until Y is complete"
- Added warning in nixpkgs section with conditions
- Emphasized Runtime must be 80%+ before other work

### 4. **Added Documentation Requirements**
- Added specific documentation URLs for every builtin
- Added mandatory process: Read docs → Test in nix repl → Search examples → Implement
- Enhanced Phase 1-4 with direct links to builtins documentation
- Added detailed implementation process for optional builtins

### 5. **Strengthened Testing Guidance**
- Added "CRITICAL: ALWAYS VERIFY BEHAVIOR BEFORE IMPLEMENTING"
- Added 5-step mandatory process
- Emphasized: "NEVER change the test" if it matches nix repl
- Added reminder about Session 32's 100% bug rate discovery

The prompt.md now enforces discipline and focuses entirely on remaining work, not accomplishments. The bot will be reminded at every section to read documentation and verify against nix repl behavior.
