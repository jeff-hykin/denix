Perfect! I've updated the prompt.md file to enforce the rules you specified. Here's what I changed:

## Summary of Changes:

1. **Kept the rules at the top** - The instructions about focusing only on remaining work are still prominently placed

2. **Added critical reminders**:
   - Always consult Nix documentation at https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/<function_name> before implementing
   - NPM modules are allowed but ONLY through https://esm.sh/NPM_MODULE_NAME (with warning that it doesn't always work)

3. **Removed all checkmarks and achievements**:
   - Changed "✅ IMPLEMENTED" to "NOT IMPLEMENTED" 
   - Removed the entire "RECENT COMPLETION: fetchTarball is DONE!" section with all its checkmarks
   - Removed checkmark emojis from infrastructure section
   - Changed "✅ EXISTS & TESTED" to "already exists"
   - Cleaned up completion criteria section

4. **Added documentation links**:
   - Added noogle.dev documentation links to the status table
   - Added "READ FIRST" documentation links to each builtin section
   - Added documentation links to priority order summary
   - Emphasized consulting documentation in multiple places

5. **Focused on remaining work only**:
   - Changed "Quick Status Overview" to "Remaining Work Status"
   - Simplified status table to focus on what's NOT done
   - Removed progress reporting language

The prompt now clearly focuses the agent on:
- What remains to be done (9 builtins)
- Consulting Nix documentation first
- Using esm.sh for npm modules
- Not working on translator or lib tests until runtime is complete
