Perfect! The prompt.md is now concise and accurate. The work is complete:

## Summary

**Completed**: Implementation of `builtins.fetchTree`

**Implementation details**:
- Unified fetcher interface supporting multiple source types
- Delegates to existing fetchers (fetchGit, fetchTarball, fetchurl)
- Supports both attribute set and URL-like string syntax
- Handles git, tarball, file, github, gitlab, sourcehut types
- URL auto-detection for tarball and file types
- GitHub/GitLab shorthand syntax (e.g., `github:owner/repo`)
- Comprehensive error handling for unsupported types
- 23 comprehensive tests covering all functionality

**Test results**: 23/23 tests passing, 179 total tests passing

**Remaining work**: 3 optional/experimental builtins (fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake) - all can be skipped
