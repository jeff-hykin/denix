Excellent! The changes are in place. Let me create a summary of what I've done:

## Summary: prompt.md Updated to Enforce Strict Rules

I've successfully updated the `prompt.md` file to enforce the rules you specified. Here are the key changes:

### ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Added mandatory rules at the top** (now appears 3 times throughout the document):
   - Focus ONLY on what is NOT implemented
   - Do NOT report achievements
   - Break down tasks into smaller subtasks (1-2 hour chunks)
   - You are a senior developer - no blockers exist

2. **Added documentation-first requirement** prominently:
   - MUST read https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/<function_name> before coding
   - MUST read https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/language/builtins
   - Match Nix behavior exactly - no guessing

3. **Added npm/esm.sh usage guidelines**:
   - Allowed to use npm modules via https://esm.sh/PACKAGE_NAME
   - Warning that not all modules work through esm.sh
   - Prefer Deno standard library when available

4. **Enforced strict work order**:
   - DO NOT work on nix-lib tests until translator is complete
   - DO NOT work on translator until runtime is complete
   - IN OTHER WORDS: Finish network fetchers first!

5. **Removed achievement checkboxes (✅)** from "What remains" sections:
   - Changed "WHAT IS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED" to focus on remaining work
   - Removed "COMPLETED" sections
   - Changed infrastructure section to just list available tools (no ✅ marks)

6. **Enhanced the "FINAL REMINDERS" section**:
   - Added instruction to DELETE completed items from this document
   - Added reminder that document should ONLY contain what is NOT done
   - Emphasized reading documentation BEFORE writing any code

### 📋 Document Structure Now:

1. **Top section**: Mandatory rules + work order (very strict)
2. **What Remains**: 5 unimplemented builtins (no completed items listed)
3. **Current Status**: Only shows what's NOT done (29% done → 5 fetchers remain)
4. **Implementation Plan**: Detailed fetchGit breakdown (remove when complete)
5. **Available Infrastructure**: Lists tools without celebration
6. **Final Reminders**: Reinforces rules one last time

The agent should now:
- Focus only on fetchGit implementation
- Read noogle.dev documentation first
- Not celebrate or report achievements
- Delete completed items from the document
- Stay in Phase 1 (runtime) until ALL fetchers are done
