Perfect! Now let me provide a summary to the user:

## Summary

I've reviewed the current state of the denix project and updated **prompt.md** with detailed remaining work. The prompt.md already focuses on what remains to be done (no accomplishment reporting), and I've enhanced it with:

### Key Findings:

1. **All tests passing** ✅
   - 73 test suites running successfully
   - Import system fully implemented and working
   - 15 nixpkgs.lib files tested

2. **README.md is outdated** 🔧
   - Shows 59 builtins (actual: **61**)
   - Shows 120+ runtime tests (actual: **170+**)
   - Shows 67 translator tests (actual: **87**)
   - Lists `import`/`scopedImport` as unimplemented (actual: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED!**)

3. **prompt.md organization** 📋
   - Already well-structured with 5 priority levels
   - Priority 0: Quick fixes (30 min) - README update
   - Priority 1: Examples directory (2-3 days)
   - Priority 2: More nixpkgs.lib testing (4-6 days)
   - Priority 3: Store path system (1-2 weeks)
   - Priority 4: Network fetchers (3-5 weeks)
   - Priority 5: Advanced features (multi-month)

### Updated prompt.md:
- Added specific line numbers for README.md corrections
- Emphasized that import system is **implemented**, not blocked
- Clarified STATUS.md badge references need fixing (file doesn't exist)
- Maintained focus on remaining work only (per your instructions)

**Recommended next step**: Update README.md with accurate numbers (Priority 0 task, ~30 minutes).
