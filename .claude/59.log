Excellent! The prompt.md is now 756 lines (was 645 lines) with comprehensive implementation details. Now let me create a quick summary document showing the current accurate status:

## Summary

I've thoroughly reviewed and updated **prompt.md** with accurate implementation details for the remaining work. Here's what I found and corrected:

### Critical Correction - Wrong Numbers in MEMORY.md

**MEMORY.md incorrectly claims**: 61/98 builtins implemented  
**Actual reality**: **93/98 builtins implemented** (verified by checking runtime.js)

The confusion came from:
- **Infrastructure is COMPLETE**: fetcher.js, tar.js, nar_hash.js, store_manager.js all exist and work
- **Already working**: fetchTarball, fetchurl, builtins.path, filterSource (4 major fetchers)
- **Only 5 functions throw NotImplemented**: fetchGit, fetchTree, fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake

### What Remains to Implement

**5 builtins remain unimplemented** (in priority order):

1. **fetchGit** (HIGH PRIORITY) - 14-16 hours
   - Most important remaining builtin
   - Required for flakes, modern nixpkgs
   - Blocks fetchTree
   - Full documentation from Nix 2.18 manual added to prompt.md

2. **fetchTree** (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - 6-8 hours  
   - Experimental unified fetcher
   - Depends on fetchGit
   - Delegates to fetchGit/fetchTarball/fetchurl

3. **fetchMercurial** (LOW PRIORITY) - 8-10 hours
   - Rarely used (legacy Mercurial support)
   - Optional - can skip without impact

4. **fetchClosure** (DEFER) - 40+ hours
   - Experimental binary cache feature
   - Extremely complex
   - Recommend skipping unless explicitly needed

5. **getFlake** (DO NOT IMPLEMENT) - 80+ hours
   - Requires complete flake system
   - Experimental, massive complexity
   - Not needed for basic Nix evaluation

### Updated prompt.md (645→756 lines)

Added comprehensive details for each builtin:
- ✅ Official Nix 2.18 documentation links
- ✅ Exact parameter specifications
- ✅ Return value structures  
- ✅ 10-phase implementation plan for fetchGit
- ✅ Testing requirements (13+ test cases)
- ✅ Verification checklist (5 categories)
- ✅ Realistic implementation timeline
- ✅ Clear recommendations (implement 2, skip 3)

### Recommended Path Forward

**Week 1-2**: Implement fetchGit → 94/98 complete (96%)  
**Week 2-3**: Implement fetchTree → 95/98 complete (97%)  
**Stop there**: Excellent coverage without implementing rarely-used experimental features

The updated prompt.md now contains everything needed to implement the remaining builtins with accurate time estimates and complete technical specifications.
