Excellent! Now let me create a quick summary for the user:

## Summary

I've successfully analyzed and simplified the denix codebase. Here's what I found and did:

### ✅ Cleanup Completed (40 minutes)

**Removed dead code:**
- Deleted `curlString` from `tools/generic.js` (unused function)
- Deleted `nixFileToXml` from `tools/parsing.js` (unused function)  
- Removed unused `StackManager` imports from `main.js` and `main/runtime.js`

**Total impact:** Removed ~19 lines of unused code, all tests still passing ✅

### 🔍 Key Findings

**Codebase Health: EXCELLENT** ✅
- No significant bloat found (only 3 unused functions)
- No circular dependencies
- No duplicate test names across 30 test files
- Logical directory structure
- Good separation of concerns (main/, tools/, main/tests/)

**The codebase is already clean and well-organized.** There's nothing major to simplify.

### 📋 Priority Correction

The REAL priority is **runtime testing**, not cleanup:

**Current state:**
- Runtime: 109/109 builtins implemented ✅ but only 42/109 tested (38.5%) ❌
- Translator: 87/87 tests passing ✅ (production ready)
- Derivations: Working ✅ (12+ tests)
- Import system: Working ✅ (49 tests)
- Fetch system: Working ✅ (97 tests)

**What needs to be done:**
Create 6 test files for 55 untested builtins:
1. Type checking (10 functions, 3-4h) 🔥 START HERE
2. List operations (12 functions, 6-8h) 🔥 CRITICAL  
3. Attrset operations (7 functions, 4-6h) 🔥 CRITICAL
4. String operations (8 functions, 4-5h)
5. Math operations (8 functions, 3-4h)
6. Path operations (10 functions, 4-6h)

**Total:** 24-33 hours → 89% coverage

### 📄 Documentation Created

1. **SIMPLIFICATION_PLAN.md** (350+ lines) - Complete architectural analysis
2. **CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** (250+ lines) - What was done and why
3. **prompt.md** (473 lines) - Completely rewritten with clear priorities

The prompt.md now:
- Focuses on what's NOT done (not achievements)
- Has nix repl examples for every task
- Clear 6-task roadmap with time estimates
- Lists all 67 untested functions with line numbers
- Provides test templates and process

### 🎯 Bottom Line

**Simplification:** Done ✅ (minimal work needed, already clean)
**Testing:** This is where 99% of effort should go (24-33 hours)

The codebase is well-architected. The other bot should focus entirely on creating test files, not on refactoring or cleanup.
