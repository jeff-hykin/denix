Perfect! Now let me create a final summary of the architectural review:

## Architectural Review Complete ✅

### Actions Taken

1. **Removed redundant documentation** (824 lines → 220 lines in prompt.md)
   - Deleted: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (168 lines) - info now in README
   - Deleted: `BUILTIN_COVERAGE.md` (324 lines) - detailed coverage analysis was outdated
   - Simplified: `prompt.md` (824 → 220 lines) - focused on essential tasks only
   - Updated: `README.md` - corrected coverage stats (41% not 26%)
   - Rewrote: `ARCHITECTURE.md` - comprehensive architectural overview

2. **Enhanced test runner** (`test.sh`)
   - Added Task 1-6 shortcuts: `./test.sh types`, `./test.sh lists`, etc.
   - Each shows helpful error if test file doesn't exist yet
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing commands

3. **Documented non-core directories**
   - `run/` - Marked as deprecated development automation
   - Clear separation between core project and tooling

4. **Corrected all documentation**
   - Runtime: 40/97 tested (41%), not 28/97 (26%)
   - 57 untested builtins, not 69
   - All known bugs already fixed

### Current Project State

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean separation: translator (main.js), runtime (main/runtime.js), tools (tools/)
- ✅ Good test organization: 27 files in main/tests/
- ✅ Simple test runner with category support
- ✅ Zero npm dependencies (URL imports only)
- ✅ No architectural debt or duplicate code

**Focus Areas:**
- ⚠️ Runtime testing: 41% coverage → need 80%
- 🎯 57 untested builtins need test coverage
- 📋 Clear task breakdown in prompt.md (Tasks 1-6)

### Documentation Structure (Now 3 Core Files)

1. **README.md** - Quick start, features, status
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Design decisions, component overview
3. **prompt.md** - Development guide (what needs testing)

Supporting docs:
- **TESTING.md** - Test organization reference
- **test.sh** - Executable test runner

### Key Architectural Decisions Documented

1. **BigInt for integers** - Correct division semantics
2. **Object.create() for scopes** - Preserves lazy evaluation
3. **~/.cache/denix/store/** - No root permissions
4. **URL imports only** - Deno-first design
5. **Lazy evaluation** - lazyMap proxy, cached getters
6. **nixScope object** - Avoids keyword conflicts

### Next Steps (For Other Bot)

**Immediate action:** Create `main/tests/builtins_types_test.js` (Task 1)

Test 9 type checking functions:
- isNull, isBool, isInt, isFloat, isString, isList, isPath, isAttrs, typeOf
- 50+ test cases total
- 3-4 hours estimated

Run with: `./test.sh types`

The codebase is now **simple, organized, and focused**. All documentation is accurate and consolidated. The only remaining work is systematic testing of 57 untested builtins.
