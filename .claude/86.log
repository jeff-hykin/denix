Perfect! Now let me create a concise summary of what I've done:

I've reviewed the current state of the Denix project and updated the documentation to accurately reflect what remains to be done:

## Key Findings

**Good news:** The project is in much better shape than prompt.md indicated!
- ✅ Derivation tests are PASSING (12/12), not failing
- ✅ The derivation bug fix was already applied
- ✅ 240+ tests passing overall
- ✅ 95% of runtime complete (62/65 builtins)

## Updated Documentation

**prompt.md** (now 427 lines):
- Removed incorrect "critical bug" section about derivation store paths
- Added accurate "What's Working" vs "What's NOT Working" breakdown
- Added QUICK DECISION GUIDE at top showing immediate next steps
- Enhanced Priority 1 with specific derivation edge case test breakdown
- Corrected flaky network test status (has graceful error handling)

**MEMORY.md**:
- Updated current status to reflect derivation tests passing
- Added Session 28 entry documenting this review
- Corrected next priority to derivation edge cases

## What Actually Remains

**Priority 1: Derivation Edge Cases** (2-3 hours)
- Test multiple outputs, passthru/meta attrs, string context propagation

**Priority 2: Optional Builtins** (DECISION NEEDED - 16-22 days OR skip)
- fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake (rarely used, experimental)

**Priority 3: Translator Edge Cases** (12-17 hours)
- Pattern matching, string escapes, path literals, operator precedence

**Priority 4: nixpkgs.lib Testing** (4-6 days)
- Expand from 10/41 files to 21+ files (50%+ coverage)

The recommended path is: Priority 1 → Skip Priority 2 → Priority 3 → Priority 4 (6-8 days total to production-ready).
