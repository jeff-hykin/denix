Perfect! Now let me create a final summary for the user:

## Summary

I've reviewed the current state of the denix project and updated all documentation to reflect **only what remains to be done**.

### Current Status

**Runtime:** 93/98 builtins implemented (95% complete)  
**Tests:** 146 tests passing across 33 test suites (all passing ✅)  
**Infrastructure:** All required modules exist and are functional

### What Remains Unimplemented

**5 builtins throw NotImplemented errors:**

1. **builtins.fetchGit** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Location: main/runtime.js line 879
   - Time: 14-16 hours
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Blocks: fetchTree depends on this
   - Impact: Required for git dependencies, flakes, nixpkgs development

2. **builtins.fetchTree** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Optional)
   - Location: main/runtime.js line 885
   - Time: 6-8 hours
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Requires: fetchGit must be done first
   - Impact: Experimental unified fetcher interface

3. **builtins.fetchMercurial** (LOW PRIORITY - Skip)
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Reason: Rarely used, legacy feature

4. **builtins.fetchClosure** (DEFER - Skip)
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Reason: Experimental, very complex (40+ hours)

5. **builtins.getFlake** (DO NOT IMPLEMENT - Skip)
   - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Reason: Massive undertaking (80-120+ hours), experimental

### Documentation Updated

1. **prompt.md** - Streamlined to focus on remaining work only
   - Removed achievement language
   - Added quick status summary
   - Clarified priorities (fetchGit is the only high-priority task)
   - Reduced redundancy

2. **REMAINING_WORK.md** - Created comprehensive reference document
   - Executive summary of what's left
   - Detailed breakdown of each unimplemented builtin
   - Implementation plans and challenges
   - Success criteria and recommendations

### Next Steps

**Immediate Priority:** Implement builtins.fetchGit
- Read documentation: https://noogle.dev/f/builtins/fetchGit
- Follow 10-phase implementation plan in prompt.md (lines 213-339)
- Create comprehensive test suite (13 test cases minimum)
- Verify against real public git repositories

**After fetchGit (Optional):** Implement builtins.fetchTree
- Only if requested by user
- Provides unified fetcher interface
- Depends on fetchGit being complete first

**Skip:** fetchMercurial, fetchClosure, getFlake (unless explicitly requested)

### Files for Reference

- **prompt.md** (958 lines) - Main task document with implementation details
- **REMAINING_WORK.md** (NEW, 330 lines) - Executive summary of remaining work
- **NEXT_STEPS.md** (316 lines) - Quick start code examples (note: focused on fetchTarball which is already done)
- **README.md** - Project overview (already accurate)
