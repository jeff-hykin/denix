Perfect! Now let me create a concise summary message for the user:

## Summary of Documentation Updates

I've analyzed the current state of the denix runtime and **corrected the test coverage numbers** in `prompt.md`. Here's what remains to be done:

### Current Accurate State
- **96 function builtins** implemented (100% feature complete for Nix 2.18)
- **40 functions tested** (42% coverage) 
- **56 functions untested** (58% remaining)
- **~150+ tests passing** across all test files

### Corrected Priority Breakdown (Path to 80%)

**Priorities 1-5 need 29 functions tested in ~14-17 hours:**

1. **Priority 1: Type Checking** (9 functions, 3-4h) ⚡ START HERE
   - isNull, isBool, isInt, isFloat, isString, isList, isPath, isAttrs, typeOf
   - Create: `main/tests/builtins_type_checking_test.js` (DOES NOT EXIST)

2. **Priority 2: List Operations** (6 functions, 3-4h) ⚡ CRITICAL  
   - elem, elemAt, partition, sort, genList, concatLists
   - Create: `main/tests/builtins_lists_comprehensive_test.js` (DOES NOT EXIST)
   - Note: map, filter, all, any already tested via library code

3. **Priority 3: Attrset Operations** (3 functions, 2-3h)
   - getAttr, catAttrs, genericClosure  
   - Create: `main/tests/builtins_attrs_comprehensive_test.js` (DOES NOT EXIST)

4. **Priority 4: String Operations** (4 functions, 2-3h)
   - split, splitVersion, baseNameOf, dirOf
   - Create: `main/tests/builtins_strings_comprehensive_test.js` (DOES NOT EXIST)

5. **Priority 5: Math & Bitwise** (7 functions, 2-3h)
   - sub, mul, ceil, floor, bitAnd, bitOr, bitXor
   - Create: `main/tests/builtins_math_comprehensive_test.js` (DOES NOT EXIST)

### Key Corrections Made
- Changed count from "62 untested" to **56 untested** (some were already tested via library code)
- Changed count from "109 functions" to **96 functions** (12 are constants, not functions)
- Updated time estimates to reflect actual function counts
- Added table showing exactly which 29 functions reach 80% coverage
- Marked which functions are already tested indirectly

### Next Step
Start with **Priority 1: Type Checking Tests** (3-4 hours). The prompt.md file now has exact step-by-step instructions at the top.
