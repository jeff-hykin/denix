Perfect! Now the prompt.md is updated with a clear plan focused on what remains to be done. The document now has:

1. **Builtins section** - Detailed breakdown of fetchurl and fetchTarball implementation with subtasks
2. **Examples section** - Clear structure for the examples directory
3. **nixpkgs.lib testing** - List of remaining files to test
4. **Timeline** - Week-by-week breakdown of immediate tasks

All achievements have been removed, and only remaining work is documented. The tasks are broken down into concrete, actionable items with checkboxes.
