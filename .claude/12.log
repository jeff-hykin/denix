Perfect! The repository is now well-organized with:
- **5 current files** in root (prompt.md, README.md, STATUS.md, TRANSLATOR_STATUS.md, and the session file)
- **9 archived files** properly moved to archive/

## Summary

I've successfully resumed the work on the denix project and completed the next major milestone:

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Organized the repository** - Moved old session and status files to `archive/` directory to reduce clutter

2. **Tested translator against nixpkgs.lib patterns** - Created a comprehensive test suite (`nixpkgs_simple_test.js`) with 13 tests validating common patterns:
   - Higher-order functions (map, filter, fold, pipe)
   - Function composition and currying
   - Recursion (factorial)
   - Attribute set operations
   - List operations
   - All 13 tests pass! ✅

3. **Documented translator capabilities** - Created `TRANSLATOR_STATUS.md` with comprehensive analysis of:
   - What works (59 tests passing)
   - Known limitations (1 issue: interpolated has-attr)
   - Test coverage breakdown
   - Performance considerations
   - Next steps

4. **Updated all documentation** - Updated `prompt.md`, `README.md`, and created `MEMORY.md` with current project status

### Key Findings

✅ **Translator is production-ready** for:
- Pure Nix expressions (no imports)
- Common nixpkgs.lib patterns
- All core language features

⚠️ **One known issue**: Interpolated has-attr (`attrset ? ${var}`) at line 507 in main.js

### Test Results
- **Runtime**: 120+ tests passing
- **Translator**: 59 tests passing (↑13 new tests)
- **Total**: 180+ tests passing across the entire project

The next steps would be to either fix the interpolated has-attr issue or begin testing against full nixpkgs.lib files (which would require working through the import system).
