Perfect! Everything is working. Now let me create a comprehensive summary document:

## Summary of Architectural Changes

### 🗑️ **Deleted (Bloat Removal)**
1. **`run/` directory** - Deprecated multi-bot automation scripts (not needed for development)
2. **`TESTING_STATUS.md`** - Redundant file duplicating content from `prompt.md` and `TESTING.md`

### 📝 **Refocused Documentation**

**prompt.md** (primary development guide):
- Added "Architecture Philosophy: SIMPLICITY FIRST" at top
- Clarified derivations are WORKING (12/12 tests), not blocking
- Emphasized critical gap: Most-used functions untested (map, filter, getAttr)
- Added priority ranking: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
- Created architecture-driven self-check questions
- Removed confusing derivation bug warnings (derivations work!)

**ARCHITECTURE.md**:
- Updated development priority section with clear reasoning
- Removed reference to deleted `run/` directory
- Added "WHY" explanation for priority decisions

**README.md**:
- Updated builtin count: 97 → 109 (accurate)
- Updated status to reflect 37% coverage (not 41%)
- Clarified current priority: critical functions first

### 📊 **Current Project State**

**Codebase Size:**
- 46 JavaScript files (main code + tests + tools)
- 25 test files in `main/tests/`
- ~1,289 lines of documentation (5 .md files)

**Structure (Clean & Simple):**
```
denix/
├── main.js                 # Translator (1,278 lines)
├── main/
│   ├── runtime.js          # Runtime (2,314 lines, 109 builtins)
│   ├── import_*.js         # Import system (3 files)
│   ├── fetcher/store       # Infrastructure (4 files)
│   └── tests/              # All tests (25 files)
├── tools/                  # Utilities (11 files)
├── test.sh                 # Test runner
└── *.md                    # Documentation (5 files)
```

**Test Runner (`./test.sh`):**
- ✅ Well-organized with category support
- ✅ Clear help text and error messages
- ✅ Supports: all tests, types, lists, attrs, strings, math, paths, core, translator, derivation, import, infra, integration
- ✅ No changes needed - optimal as-is

### 🎯 **Refocused Priorities**

**OLD priority (unclear):**
> "Test 57 untested builtins to reach 80% coverage"

**NEW priority (architecture-driven):**
> "Test critical functions FIRST (map, filter, getAttr), THEN reach 80%"

**Reasoning:**
- `map` and `filter` are used in EVERY Nix file
- Testing them ensures runtime works for real-world code
- Current 37% coverage is missing the most important functions
- Derivations already work (12/12 tests) - not a priority

### ✅ **What's Complete (Skip These)**
- Translator: 100% (87/87 tests)
- Import system: 100% (5 test files)
- Derivations: WORKING (12/12 basic tests)
- Type checking: 100% (10/10 functions)

### ⚠️ **What Needs Work (Focus Here)**
- **CRITICAL**: Test map, filter, all, any, getAttr, attrNames, attrValues (7 functions, ~4-6 hours)
- **HIGH**: Test remaining list/attrset ops (19 functions, ~8-12 hours)
- **MEDIUM**: Test string/math/path ops (20 functions, ~9-13 hours)
- **LOW**: Hashing, control flow, advanced (23 functions, ~10-15 hours)

### 📈 **Impact of Changes**

**Before:**
- 5 documentation files with overlapping content
- Unclear whether derivations were blocking progress
- Priority buried deep in prompt.md
- `run/` directory suggesting multi-bot workflow

**After:**
- 4 focused documentation files (no overlap)
- Clear: derivations work, test builtins first
- Priority emphasized at top with reasoning
- Clean single-developer workflow

**Result:** Simpler, cleaner, more focused codebase. Next developer knows exactly what to do: test critical builtins.
