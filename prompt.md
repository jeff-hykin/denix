## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

**Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working. Only report what remains to be done. Do not report what you accomplished. You are a senior level developer, there is no such thing as a blocker. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks.**

**Before executing what is below, please filter out any achievements. Only keep remaining/unsolved tasks in this document. Add detail to each task if its needed.**

- Start using `convertToJs` from `main.js` to convert Nix to JavaScript. Add any missing functionality. Start with simple nix code from the nixpkgs-lib (which is available in tests) and continually test against more complicated nix code.
