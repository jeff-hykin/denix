# Task: Implement a translator from Nix to JavaScript

Your job is to focus on what is NOT implemented and NOT working. Only report what remains to be done. Do not report what you accomplished. You are a senior level developer, there is no such thing as a blocker. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks.

Before executing what is below, please filter out any achievements. Only keep remaining/unsolved tasks in this document. Add detail to each task if its needed.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
- Do not work on nix-lib tests until the code translator is fully implemented.
- Do not work on the translator until the runtime is fully implemented.
- (in other words finish the network fetchers and store functions in runtime.js before doing ANYTHING ELSE)


Status:
- Runtime: 37/98 Nix 2.18 builtins not working
- Need to start working on store functions and fetchers
- Most lib files should work immediately, just need testing


**HIGHEST PRIORITY**: get `fetchTarball` working in any form.
